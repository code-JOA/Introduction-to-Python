    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this section, you'll learn about experimental design and hypothesis testing. All scientific research that comes out of universities uses hypothesis testing to determine if the results of an experiment are significant or not. As a data scientist, you might be tasked with designing, performing, and analyzing the results of an experiment.\n",

    "## Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll be looking at experimental design, effect size, T-tests and Type 1 and Type 2 errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Without good experimental design, it's very easy to draw the wrong conclusions from your experiments. Because of that, you'll kick this section off by looking at the scientific method and the key elements of good experimental design - forming **alternative** and **null hypotheses**, conducting an experiment, analyzing the results for statistical significance and drawing conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect Size\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look at how to calculate and interpret the size of the difference between control and test groups. We'll see how the \"Effect Size\" can be used to communicate the practical significance of experimental results, to perform meta-analyses of multiple studies, and to perform power analysis to determine the number of participants that a study would require to achieve a certain probability of finding a true effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "### One and Two Sample T-tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you'll also look at t-tests and how they can be used to compare two averages to see how significant the differences are between one or two samples once we have defined the experimental design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type 1 and Type 2 Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, you'll learn about **type 1 (false positive)** and **type 2 (false negative) errors** and the inherent tradeoff between them.\n",
    "\n"

    "\n",
    "Without a good understanding of experimental design, it's easy to end up confusing spurious correlations for meaningful results or placing too much (or too little) weight on the results of any given test. In this section, we cover a range of tools and techniques to ensure that you design your experiments rigorously and interpret them thoughtfully."
