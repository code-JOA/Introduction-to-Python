    "## Introduction\n",
    "+ In this lesson, we'll learn how to read some of the more common mathematical notation that you'll see when reading equations pertaining to Data Science.\n",

    "## Understanding Mathematical Notation\n",
    "+ When learning Data Science, running into dense, arcane-looking mathematical equations is an inevitability. For instance, here's an equation for a machine learning algorithm called a Support Vector Machine that you'll learn about later in the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\LARGE \\text{minimize:} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\LARGE W(\\alpha) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell}\\alpha_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell}\\sum_{j=1}^{\\ell}y_iy_j\\alpha_i\\alpha_j\\textbf{x}_i\\textbf{x}_j$$\n",

    "At first glance, equations like this often seem impenetrable and impossible to understand. If seeing math like this makes you nervous, don't worry--you're not alone! This is a particularly dense example of mathematical notation, but at the end of the day, it's just a recipe for an algorithm. Whereas we are used to expressing our algorithms in code, mathematicians prefer to use Mathematical Notation, to express big ideas in small, dense packages full of Greek letters, subscripts, and superscripts. Although these look intimidating in the beginning, they'll seem a lot more manageable once we've learned some basic mathematical notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to remember is that there are many, many mathematical symbols. DO NOT bother trying to memorize them--that's a waste of time. Instead, keep a cheat sheet handy! And, as with all things, remember that Google is your friend. There is no shame in looking it up. As a Junior Data Scientist, you're going to be spending an embarrassing amount of time using Google and Stack Overflow to look up things that you don't know. As a Senior Data Scientist, you'll spend the same amount of time doing this--you just won't be embarrassed by it anymore!\n",
    "\n",
    "We've included a cheat sheet in this repo (see below) that you should store in an easy-to-find place on your computer. You'll be using it plenty as a Data Scientist. You'll notice that the cheat sheet also contains examples that go with each notation. Use these to your advantage! Toy examples are your friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cheat sheet works wonders for most of the symbols included on that document. However, there are two types of notation that are worth examining in more depth: Summations, and Products.\n",

    "This is pretty simple code--just a for-loop that calculates the sum total of every number between 1 and 5, inclusive (meaning it stops after including 5 in the total, not before, which is why we put n+1 in the range instead of just n).\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematician would express the same algorithm using the following Sigma Notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\LARGE \\sum_{n=1}^{5} x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty nifty, huh? The equation above says that we should start counting at 1, because we see n=1 under the summation. We should stop once we've hit 5 (inclusive). Our sum totals the sum of each value of X for each step between n=1 and up to (and including) n=5.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to write it out explicitly, it would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\LARGE \\sum_{n=1}^{5} x = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the most simple example of summation since we were just adding in the individual value at each step in the example above. However, we can put anything we want to the right of the Sigma symbol, and this will be what happens at each step. For example, let's consider the following code:\n",

The Sigma Notation starts at 1 because mathematicians start counting at 1, whereas programmers start counting at 0. Remember this--it'll save you from buggy code later on!\n"
