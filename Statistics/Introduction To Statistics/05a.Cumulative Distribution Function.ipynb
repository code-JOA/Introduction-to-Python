    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF function that we saw before works great for inspecting discrete random variables and calculating their expected values. However, we did see that when moving towards continuous random variables, obtaining probabilities for observing a specific outcome is not possible (or, simply put, the probabilities were 0). We also noted that when working with PDFs, you can't really read the y-axis and have to be careful with interpretation. In this lesson, you'll learn about the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and how it is useful to overcome these issues.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",

    "* Differentiate between a PMF, PDF, and a CDF in terms of cumulative probabilities \n",
    "* Calculate CDF in Python for a given discrete variable with limited set of possible values\n",
    "* Visualize and inspect a given CDF in order to make assumptions about the underlying data "

    "Recall how we could easily read probabilities from the dice PMF plot (\"The probability of throwing a 4 is 16.66%\"), but it is much harder to interpret the temperature PDF. What is the probability that the temperature is exactly 80 degrees? We learned in the previous lesson that all these so-called \"point probabilities\" are 0, so the bottom line is that it is very hard to \"read\" any interesting information from a PDF. The PDF is mainly there to get a sense of the data density, but you cannot readily read the y-axis to get to probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did see last that when you want to calculate probabilities, you need to take integrals and look at ranges of values of your continuous random variables.
