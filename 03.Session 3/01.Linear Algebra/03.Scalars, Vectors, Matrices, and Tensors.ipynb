    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this lesson, you'll be introduced to the basic mathematical entities used in linear algebra. We'll also look at how these entities are created (and later manipulated) in Python using NumPy. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors \n",
    "- Create vectors and matrices using Numpy and Python\n",
    "- Use the transpose method to transpose Numpy matrices \n",

    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by defining some mathematical entities that data scientists routinely come across while dealing with machine learning and deep learning algorithms. These entities are used to store, process and represent our data and analytical activities are mainly focused on manipulating these algebraic entities to provide solutions to unknown data entities. \n",

    "## Scalars\n",
    "> A scalar is a **single number** \n",
    "\n",
    "A scalar is the simplest entity in linear algebra compared to other objects, which are usually arrays of multiple numbers. In literature, you'll find scalars represented as lower case italics characters. Scalars need to be defined in terms of the type of number they carry. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Real valued scalars**: Let $S \\in  \\mathbb{R} $  be the salary of an individual\n",
    "* **Natural number scalars**: Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be the number of floors in a building\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors \n",
    "\n",
    "> A vector is an **array** of numbers arranged in some order, as opposed to the single numbered scalar. \n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers contained within a vector are known as scalar components of the vector. Vectors are built from individual components, which are numerical in nature. We can think of a vector as a list of numbers, and vector algebra as operations performed on the numbers in the list. \n",

    "  x_{n} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x$ is the name of the vector and $(x_1,x_2, \\ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n)$ are the scalar components of the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning systems like regression you saw earlier, the output variable is known as a **target vector** with the lowercase $y$ when describing the training of a machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can set index values to elements of a vector by defining a set containing the indices and write the set as a subscript. For example, to access $x_1, x_3$ and $x_6$, we define the set $S=\\{1,3,6\\}$, and call it $x_S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A geometric intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector can be thought of as an entity that represents spatial coordinates in an n-dimensional space, where n is the number of dimensions. A vector can also represent a line from the origin of the vector space with a direction and a magnitude, based on scalar components. Below is an example of a vector in 3D vector space:  \n",
