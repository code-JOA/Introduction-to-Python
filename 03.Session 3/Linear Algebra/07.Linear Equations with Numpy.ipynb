    "In this lesson, you'll learn how to solve a system of linear equations using matrix algebra and Numpy.  You'll also learn about the identity matrix and inverse matrices, which have some unique properties that can be used to solve for unknown values in systems of linear equations. You'll also learn how to create these using Numpy. \n",

    "- Define the identity matrix and its dot product \n",
