    "\n",
    "This lesson is a supplement to the previous lesson where you learned how to create Numpy arrays as vectors and matrices. In this lesson, you'll look at matrix addition and broadcasting features offered by Numpy.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- Implement vector addition in Numpy \n",
    "- Describe how broadcasting differs from addition if there are mismatched dimensions \n",

    "1D-arrays can be added together in exactly the same way using similar assumptions. The addition of two vectors $x$ and $y$ may be represented graphically by placing the start of the arrow y at the tip of the arrow x, and then drawing an arrow from the start (tail) of $x$ to the tip (head) of $y$. The new arrow represents the vector $x + y$.\n",
