    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Understanding matrix operations is very important for a deeper understanding of linear algebra. We know matrices are used throughout the field of machine learning in the description of algorithms and representation of data. In this lesson, we shall discover how to manipulate matrices in Python and Numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",

    "- Compute the dot product for matrices and vectors \n",

    "\n",
    "Two matrices with the same dimensions can be multiplied together. Such element-wise matrix multiplication is called the Hadamard product. It's not the typical operation meant when referring to matrix multiplication, therefore a different operator is often used, such as a circle $\\circ$. \n",
