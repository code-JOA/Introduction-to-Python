They have great lunch specials... Leticia is super nice and cares about what you think of her restaurant. You have to try their cheese enchiladas too the sauce is different And amazing!!!,0,msQe1u7Z_XuqjGoqhB0J5g

Who does that? They dont control their crowd. Many times I've gone I've seen fights. The bartenders suck - I've almost got in a fight with one because she was a complete bitch. Refused to serve me a drink because she was busy celebrating her friends birthday BEHIND THE BAR. This place is ridiculous. I will NEVER go there again.. EVER.,2,msQe1u7Z_XuqjGoqhB0J5g

The items were either bland or stale. My friend had a potato curry which was completely stale without salt. The biriyani was okayish but bland.

After trying many Mexican restaurants all thru Phoenix & Scottsdale we found an authentic Mexican restaurant that was AMAZING! Fresh tortilla chip & salsa ready and waiting at the table when we sat down. Food was incredible! I ordered the combo with a beef tamale with red sauce & chicken enchilada. Both were full of meat from beginning to end & had so much flavor! Highly recommend this place,0,5ngpW5tf3ep680eG1HxHzA
25,f-v1fvtnbdw_QQRsCnwH-g,0,2017-11-18,0,alI_kRKyEHfdHibYGgtJbw,1,I have to write a review on the Fractured Prune. First off I love doughnuts second I used to work in a bakery. So I know a little about the almighty doughnut. I was there this past Thursday night at Westgate where I was having a nice dinner at Opah Life. I wanted a little desert so I went to this doughnut shop it seemed clean enough so I made my selections and took them home. Mistake should have eaten one there I would have ask for my money back. I took a bite out of each on to confirm what I thought they were the worst doughnuts I have ever had. Horrible not sure if the oils was rancid or not hot enough either way eat at your own risk.,0,Fc_nb6N6Sdurqb-rwsY1Bw
26,yz66FIUPDKGhILDWzRLeKg,0,2017-11-18,0,85DRIjwPJOTb4q0qOlBstw,1,I wish i could tell you all about the food but there was problem. My friend and went there for dinner we were seated quickly unfortunately it was in middle of the empty dinning room so we asked to be moved to the side which we were. Upon sitting down we were told we could only have one of the very small table tops there were two together so the hostess told us the manager said we couldn't use two table tops in the empty restaurant. So we got up and left. With the manager chasing us blaming the hostess for the the ridiculous action. Needles to say we will never return.,1,Fc_nb6N6Sdurqb-rwsY1Bw

Love that the cast interactions with all guests in a semi intimate setting. Each course is delivered between scenes and you're given time to eat so you don't miss the show. 

Food was pretty decent as well. Like the salad dressing and love the sauce on the chicken. Bring cash for the bar and especially for the tip. Cast/staff work hard and deserve it :)

4 stars since I'm bummed there were no mojitos.,0,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ
79,yz3KtngrF2PQrif8JW7gdw,0,2016-05-28,0,SLA1YP9doUc8h-6Kd34QmA,1,Horrible. The smart ones have closed their account. Tellers don't know how to read a day drop envelope that clearly reads MORTGAGE PAYMENT in front and back with the full loan number on it. Money was sitting in the account and in the meantime my mortgage was late. This has happened 4 times. 4 TIMES. 

Manager doesn't take accountability for the lack of attention to detail of his staff or their errors.  Tried to blame me because they didnt believe I put anything on the envelope. Account numbers and account holder names sitting all over Christopher the teller's desk. People wonder why your accounts are compromised? Manager saw it and did nothing. 

Be smart take you money out and run.,1,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ

102,aQ222ydz_GSRZV66xNt4kQ,0,2017-04-09,1,AxhxGl41DItKjqkzYtr53Q,1,2 of my girlfriends recommended this place so all 3 of us went.... I made sure to have an appetite when I got here..... sushi was mediocre.... what made it TERRIBLE was the service..... we were there for 2 and a half hours because our orders took about 30 min to come out whether it was appetizers or sushi.... our server's excuse was because the bar was full....? So you're telling me your main dining area (which was actually also pretty full ) should SUFFER just because the bar was full?????

Yes it takes maintenance a little longer then they should but it seems like a large place for only 2 guys to handel.   The fitness center needs a little upgrade but I have lived at other places and this is a great place.  I see a few people complaining and name calling which I find childish.

I had checked other stores first and the mattress I got was equal or even better at half the price. They even gave me sheet and cover for the mattress as a bonus for shopping at the new store.

One order was flat wrong and needed 2 sausage patties added to the plate.  I kindly pointed the mistake out.  Pointed to the menu which supported my claim and she declined to make it right.  The person behind me then told her she was wrong and she correct my order.  I left and went back to eat my food with no resolution to the issue.

She knew nothing about her drinks list or about the food ... Was gone when we kept trying to order more food (we had to order with the bar back because she took so long to show up)



FOOD: 
Tater tots :  meh not worth it 
Cauliflower app: meh over cooked and nothing special 
Corn bread: alright but really not worth it .... Unless you are feeding tweety bird. 


Kentucky handshake sandwich: not worth the price (it's literally Kentucky fried chicken ... Like might as well go there and pay $6 instead of basically $15 to look at some arm ) lol 

Chicken and Waffles : portion is not worth it flavor was alright nothing mind blowing (go to the Kensington market one ... WAYYY better and much more for your money) 
 
Red Funnel cake : save your money .... Tiny over cooked and completely over drizzled with icing ... Yuck  worst thing I have ever had in the funnel cake department.

The ladies who were making the cones were very pleasant and had great vibes... The person who was at the cash the first time I went seemed a bit stuck up but then the second time the front cash/ barista was also very pleasant and seemed to have very good vibes.... Hopefully I see more of this side the following visits too. 


LOVE the cashew latte with the Brazilian blend  perfection ! 


Ice cream ($6 I would say they should be priced more at $4) was good quality for a soft serve.... It was defiantly not the same quality as McDonald's or an ice cream truck WAY better. The only similarity is that it melts quickly ... Like any other soft serve. The cones could be a little better quality because they do get pretty soggy at the end.  

Love the creativity they have with the cones! I hope they continue to come up with new ideas. 

Small suggestion on the cinnamon one... Maybe add some nuts ... The current topping just seems so plain jane compared to the other creative cones you have! 

Definitely going back to try more flavours!,0,kBNFdviedCPFWyR-wVaAzw

They happily (literally with a smile) offered me another beverage. I felt pretty bad because I hate wasting but I just can not do sweet drinks.


FYI their matcha powder has sugar mixed into the packaging they get (just like Starbucks).... Which would be great ... Unless you are not looking for a sweet drink... 


Great news! Their soy latte is amazing! Deep rich coffee bitter flavor (which I love). I was very pleased by how calm and positive they both were with me as I am sure that was probably annoying to have to waste the product  More coffee shops should have this type of professional positive smiling customer first type of employees 


Location also has a fireplace which o imagine will be nice in the cold winter months. Washrooms are clean (probably because now they aren't bombarded with all the school children arroyos the area coming in and disrespectfully destroying it and leaving it messy every 30mins.,0,kBNFdviedCPFWyR-wVaAzw

Khao Soi ..... Not sure who paid all these reviewers to call it authentic ... I am a HUGE fan of Thai food and have NEVER had coleslaw ... Yes that's right ... Literally COLESLAW in the Khao Soi. It is disgusting. Beef was not tenderized and undercooked.  

Tom Yum - the only average thing worth maybe trying if there is nothing else open and you need food. It is heavy on the lemon grass and is missing the fundamental herbs and spices.... For starters galangal .... Had no freshness to the soup .... Tasted like over cooked boiled veggies that had some paste added  choice of meat and severed.  


Curry is not authentic at all .... It is a pre-made paste added again to something cooked separate.... Then served. A paste at a Resturant considered to be authentic should be made in house and better quality.

Chicken Wrap- Good 
Chicken is tender and cooked simple but well. Can't go wrong with the chicken. 

Steak Wrap- Usually great but last time was way over cooked... They need the cook to keep a closer eye on the meat to make sure it's still pink on the inside of the beef....

Tacos tacos  

Firstly just need to say I put the habanero hot sauce on everything here to give it a little kick! ... If you love spice defiantly try it.  Also rule of thumb *squeeze* that lime on everything ! Tacos and in drinks .... Just go wild. 

Shrimp tacos were juicy and great 

Fish taco was great and flaky 

They had a Trout taco day feature which was great (with a little lime and hot sauce)

Chicken and beef tacos had a decent amount of meat in them and were nicely cooked and shredded. 

The Vegetarian option was surprisingly also very tasty and flavourful 


Ceviche love the jalapeño touch inside but fish and tomatoes needs to be chopped up more for better chip grabbing fun. 


Margarita pitcher could use a little more lime less agave and more tequila.... Less sweetness and more pungent twist and kick in the mouth to go with those tasty tacos. (I just ordered extra tequila and added to my cup.... But I would say about 4 more shots in the pitcher would fix it)

The burger was ok; it looked to be put together as an after thought and squished. The good thing is the variety milkshake flavours. That was what I was into; but for me; the milkshakes didn't have enough of that dairy/ice cream flavour for me. It was good but not giving me a wow factor.

We didn't feel too welcome at all by the manager because we bought our 2 girls with us who behaved very well and it felt too upper class to even go there with kids even if they are older. Not a place to go with kids even though kids are allowed. 

The lasagne was good but a bit burnt on top which I didn't like. The Alfredo pasta was flavourless. Not too good. Was disappointed that they had no pizza for a month when we went there. 

The waitress was sweet. But the manager ignored us and went for the people who looked like they had more money to spend and talked to them about the variety of wines. 

There was a sign when I came in that said something like no hats allowed or take off your hats. That was fine with me but a bit taken aback by that sign which kind of set the negative tone in a sense. 

Don't think I would go again because it felt like setting a foot in a stranger's house and felt awkward there. Food was good though but hard to enjoy myself.,0,CIWmICxK1NMixvIgb5nlAg

Look you know what you're getting at this gym.  It's kind of a no frills but cheap gym that's clean enough. So it worked for me during these past years.

the daycare hours that the gym are ok but the daycare workers don't change a baby's dirty diapers and instead page the parent which is disruptive to a workout.  Also the daycare hours (for me) don't start early enough.  So I'm sad to say I'm going to be switching to another gym probably at the new year.  

But I did enjoy working out at Fitness during the past 4/5 years.  And all the gym workers are so nice and quick to help out with any billing issues (of which I have had too many!).

I had the huevos rancheros with their signature green chili and pork. So good! The portion to price ratio was a nice return to normal coming from the land of a $10 beer on the strip 30 minutes away. The eggs were cooked just right and the pork green chili was smothered over the fried tortillas and beans. If you like green chili and solid breakfast food you have to take the very quick detour into the historic downtown area. 

I'm sure there is a wait almost every weekend but that will give you some time to do some antiquing. 

I'll definitely be going back!,0,nDdcMqgQkRZuvjRzXhUJ5g
744,07F9bkUm3cs83CzGvTi0TA,1,2015-03-15,0,wgr_hOfIWlXR-glOC-qKYQ,5,Kudos to Charlotte Motor Speedway!! They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!! Way to go CMS even though we regularly attend races here you now have a customer for life!,1,Cxv3SNudPrCavvHJfIbwhQ

The 2 stars is because they no longer have limes!(trying to get a response) I ordered a margarita (ultimate which was very good) and when I asked for a lime the bartender said they had stopped ordering them because they were too expensive! Now granted this didn't make or break my meal but that was one of the strangest things I have heard. It wasn't like it was $2 margarita night ($9 to be exact) Hopefully someone in management will see this and respond.

The salesman was totally arrogant  and the Sales Manager wouldn't budge on the quoted price even though I could get the same car in Scottsdale Az for 2K less.  I just wanted an extra 500 off - nothing crazy.  I was basically told that they know they are the only game in town - only Land Rover dealer for hundreds of miles and I was just going to have to take it or leave it.  After getting totally pissed and deciding that I'll just buy the car and get screwed on a bad deal they tell me that it is getting late (Saturday 4PM) and that even if I buy the car - right now - they can't delivery it to me today because they don't have enough time.  I'll have to wait till next week to get the car I am standing right in front of.  What!!!  What kind of low budget garbage is that?  

I've never tried so hard to give someone 54K.  I'm done with these guys.  Taking my business and money somewhere else. What a joke.,5,IqZ4tKOTEwvE8RBXKpyn6w

I went to do the tests the same day. After waiting for about 2 weeks and I did not hear from Dr. Steven Folkerth about the result of my tests. I called his office and the receptionist said she has the result in. I went in to pick up a copy of the tests and the receptionist was still unfriendly. I saw that my triglycerides was above normal range and that the Vit D test was missing from the report. I asked the receptionist to locate my Vit D report and she said she is going to give me a call next day. I waited and she never call. I called her and she said she is going to get back to me. It has been 10 days since I talked to her and she never called me back. I am missing a vital part of the test because my Vit D level was low from a previous test. I understand Vit D is very important for my daily health. I got a run around. The doctor or the receptionist never contact me about my high triglycerides and missing test.

I am very disappointed from the people in this office.,1,cuphQhfXFbGr5d9MEzgXEA

How wrong I was! Upon entering the driveway it was just 'wow' all of the way. The reception was massive and they had plenty of staff ready to book you in. The only one downside was that we had to go into a smoking room which did have some smell left to it but was gone in a matter of hours and reception did tell us we could change later that afternoon if it was still bad.

The room was very spacious and the bathroom was huge. The resort is massive and trust me it will take you some time to explore. The gym had a great setup and has plenty of equipment- no waiting like at the gym back home!

We gave the buffet a go and just like everyone said it's a must visit. They make just about anything there and have heaps of options to choose from.

All up well worth the stay and couldn't believe the price compared to other hotels in the USA.

ps. the blinds in the room operate by a switch - we spent a while trying to force them open haha!,1,wcKvC0jov-kAHg-GIvWJqg

As we were only in Vegas for a few nights we wanted to make sure we got to experience as much as possible - including the dining. After doing the usual hunt on Yelp we decided to try out Spago and it was a great suggestion.

When we arrived the waiter asked if we wanted sit inside or out and we opted to go outside - best choice! To be honest I thought the blue ceiling was tacky at first but after a while it really started to trick you that you were outside!

We only went up to visit the lounge. One big downside was the cover charge ($20 each!) that we weren't expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck ;)

The drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there. But the main thing we went for (the view) was well worth it - especially at night looking right across the light beam coming from the pyramid below.,1,wcKvC0jov-kAHg-GIvWJqg

The trip was well organised with them picking us up from the hotel and then heading out to the Canyon. Our driver gave us some great commentary on the way out and had the perfect balance of not talking the whole time but still being really informative.

We stopped at a few spots on the way out including Hoover Dam and a small store for a rest stop which made the trip out there feel even more authentic going into an actual country store.

We didn't realise when we got there that we would all be going onto buses afterwards but the guide was really good at making sure we all had the freedom of looking around each lookout and then still grouping back together at the end.

Thanks for making it an easy and great trip!,0,wcKvC0jov-kAHg-GIvWJqg
786,g83WbX_recywc4DEIZ-xug,1,2013-01-20,1,TCem-xp4QstqyCZcfRKfCA,5,This place is a must visit for anyone to Las Vegas!

I'm so thankful I came across it on here as it was never suggested to us by anyone else or even at the hotel we were staying. You start off the tour at their meeting spot where they give you plenty of water and warnings about just how hot it can get in there so be careful!

We got to meet our tour guide as well who gave us a quick background on the non-profit organisation behind the museum - it's great to see such a dedicated group of people preserving what some people would just treat as junk.

It's an amazing collection of old signage and as part of the tour around the 'boneyard' the guide gave us some great (and humorous) history about Las Vegas.
 This really made the tour as there was so much we learnt at the same time and it was astonishing to learn just how much the city has changed.

If you like your photography this place is an absolute must visit. There's so many good opportunities as the place is full of so much colour and typography.

It was my first time at this salon and she was great! She was very good at was she does. We talked about what kind of cut I wanted and she listened and made some suggestions. I like that she was not overly chatty and she just did what she had to do which was to cut my hair. Leah did not act like she was my bff and I like that. I did not come there to chat but to get a good haircut. 
Leah is skilled and knows how to cut coarse asian hair. She cut my hair just like the way I wanted it and she was so nice. The cut was for $30 which was reasonable and there was no push to sell you any shampoo or hair products which I really like. I dont like to be put on the spot after a haircut to buy hair products that I do not need.
I highly recommend Leah to anyone. I am so glad to have found a great hairdresser that can cut my hair the way I want it!,0,qr9hmaIxq1z9ycgT28PpRw

Kids can swim year long and not be cold. When they get out of the pool the whole room is warmer and the showers are nearby. The facility is clean and the workers are friendly.  Kids learn at their own pace so don't expect your kids to be like Michael Phelps after they finish their summer classes.

We also tried the clam and Ginger scallions. Clams were not fresh and the sauce had too much corn starch that it was thick and startchy:(

I go to cancel my account (a month before I move) and I was told to bring all bottles and dispenser in before March 1st. I returned all bottles and dispenser on Feb. 23rd. I was given a receipt that said my account was closed and current. Today I get a bill for $30 and they say I have 5 bottles to return still!? Are you kidding me? You looked at my account on Feb. 23 and cleared it! Took 30mins on hold to get customer service and was just told that she sent an email and a response would take 3 days. If THEY determine I somehow have these mystery bottles of water that I never received I will not be refunded. AVOID THIS SERVICE! TRUST ME. Everything about closing the account was (and still is) a nightmare. Do yourself a favor and do business with someone else! Some of the WORST customer service I have seen in Las Vegas to date. Shame of businesses that know they are below standards and continue to operate without making changes to provide better service.

We played in late December so there was a frost delay but once we got off it was sunny and not very cold. The group in front of us was playing a bit slow from the outset and by the third hole the ranger was on them to speed up (which they did).

Course is playable for many skill levels. My group played the tips and are above average golfers and we enjoyed our experience a lot. It was not an overly challenging course but still required skill. Very professionally run course with 3 separate nines (we played Ironhead and Acacia). 

Course was in good shape and greens rolled true. Only additional complaint would be that the restaurant was under construction and not open for another month or so and when we went to the only other shop which had food they were out of some different beers and other items (which they had on display and made it seem like they did have them available).

There is no driving range but we went to one of the courses nearby beforehand which wasn't very far away.

Overall though thought the course was pretty solid with a nice layout. Greens in good shape. Course had some challenges but also had an overall layout that seemed to keep the ball findable because everything sloped inward. Got out at 8:45 or so and played pretty quickly.

Tour is $5 and they just take you through the warehouse and some of the brewing area. It isn't anything overly special. If you've been on other brewery tours before it is a pretty standard one.

Beer I great though. With the $5 tour you get a small tasting glass and three different tastings. They have the staples along with more seasonal and experimental type brews. Pretty reasonable prices too if you want beers/pitchers also (which you will). Pitchers are generally around $11.,2,IKChsSm17dLG0mTHjFiDLg

I got my last haircut from Ken who was great. He gave me the type of haircut I wanted while also adding his expertise. I loved the way he dried and styled my hair too.

Wasn't pleased with the gel nails either - super thick and they were totally skimpy with the nail colour.  I will never again get gel nails and I certainly won't be back where I don't get what I asked for in the first place.

We went on a Sunday afternoon and it just us and like a couple of other tables so they were not busy at all and the service was so incredibly slow and bad. Our appetizer and the kids meal we ordered came out pretty fast but then we literally waited for like 30 minutes for our food which we learned later was just sitting under the heat lamps for like 15 minutes. There were like 3 servers hanging around not busy while our food just sat there. And our server was hanging out at a table sitting with them for like 10 minutes when our food was just sitting there. Finally we got up and asked where our food was and it still took another 5 or so minutes for someone to bring it. The tacos were soggy by this time and not good. Aside from the bad service the food was just a total let down. The kids meal was gross and our tacos were soggy and it seems the oil was old because everything fried had a bad taste to it.

1484,BNtQD_aXWOA_Ip99grNMLw,0,2016-06-15,0,p3P7EtPFexolKYonxvC41A,1,Me and a group of friends went to this place one night when they had live music. We had a very bad experiance and ended up leaving because of the rude service. We were a small group and we are obviously different looking than the crowd in the restaurant. The servers at the bar where very rude and no one offered to take our order or seat us. Then there was an open booth near the front and we asked to sit at that table and one of the servers told us that it was taken even though no one was sitting there. Like 10 minutes later a white couple came in and they offered the booth to them. We finally realized that there was a back room with empty tables and we went and seated ourselves and literally waited for 15 minutes before anyone even walked over to our table to ask for our drinks. They saw us seat ourselves which is why we finally got the hint that we were not welcome and got up and left. I think unless your a local in the neighborhood I would not visit this place.

Monday night is the best night to go beer is 2 dollars and mixed drinks are 2.50. Other than Monday they are very expensive for the location and the service you receive. They have 1 or 2 great bartenders and the rest are either drunk on the job or too busy caring on conversations with their friends to get you a beer. They do have a great setup for watching sports and a lot of space. Food is pretty decent too and fairly priced. To be a mom and pops bar it's pretty decent.

After lengthy talk nice lady on phone recommended trying both since one was immediately after other. My wife took my daughter to the class while our other children at indoor soccer facility in same building. Instructor proceeded to belittle my daughter and wife by insinuating we were trying to get something for free by staying for second class.  I called in and advised them of this horrible situation and awful customer service. They DID NOT show compassion towards my issue or offer an apology for THEIR misunderstanding.I have been waiting for this company to show up on Yelp since this incident so that I can warn all of the unsuspecting people about this business. Beware. There are many other places that would love to have mine and your business. Steer clear.

She came across wonderfully in my initial meeting with her but things quickly went downhill. She showed up at my wedding with a friend that she claimed was her second photographer but I don't think that friend took any pictures. My bridesmaids later told me that Leah was saying she didn't even want to be there...I paid her plenty of money to be there! I had to beg her for pictures after a few months and then got about 100 less than what was promised in the contract. Oh and no reception pictures! I don't have a single picture of me dancing with my husband or father. I asked her about this and she came up with excuse after excuse. Finally after 8 months and the threat of a lawsuit she admitted she didn't have any pictures from the reception. Leah has changed her company name so many times (I'm sure due the bad reviews) and it makes me so mad that she's still out there duping people.

The sales associate assured us that if we canceled within the 3 year time frame we would get 100% of the warranty price back. Well here it is almost 3 years later and Sears will only refund $44 of the $249 price of the warranty.

Came a day before they opened and the lady at the cash was so friendly and welcoming. Came two days later and was not greeted at all. There was no way to tell where to order ...the guy near the food just looked at me with wide eyes. I asked for a mix plate (chicken n beef) he cuts the beef and asks me about my salad n rice choice. He adds the salad to the main part of the takeout container which is usually meant for rice. As for the rice..he litteraly gave me 3 regular size spoon fulls. Then adds the beef...i told him its mixed plate. He doesnt aknowledge. Removes some of the beef that already has tahini sauce on it and adds some chicken. I go to pay and the cashier is on his phone texting and i was visible to him. I ask if this is where i pay and he says yes and apologizes...i gave him a 20 and later realized he overcharged me by $3. The food taste was good but i would never go back. A new restaurant should embrace new customers and win them over forever. Interested to see how others were treated,3,2McB9CmWgZFlGWQozt6sOA

When she was done another lady Mimi stepped in to do the gel while the First Lady stood behind her and watched. I don't know what exactly they were saying but it was pretty apparent that she was teaching her how to do gel. Lol. Aren't you suppose to go to school and be certified to do that! Not to mention she's being trained by the worst nail technician I've ever met. Don't go here. Oh and another funny.. While I was there FedEx guy came and delivered a Manila envelope that required signature from a law firm.

2213,IPiRBDgjSFGOZeewrAVIMQ,0,2013-01-17,2,KLadJayf6GSCe0rxPbtuCA,5,I find the last review (Riki L.) Very comical. I happen to be in the store the day she came in trying to pick up her table on that Sunday. Her paperwork clearly said Monday and she had the wrong day. In fact I had to stop getting customer service so they could help her. She was yelling through the store and cussing at them using profanity I had my children in there. Total white trash is how she acted. I had to stay in the store until after they closed because of her stunt going over to the other store. She went to pick up her table at the 59th Ave. and Bell location she put it in her truck and she left and never paid for.  The owners daughter on the E. Bell Rd. location called her several times as I was sitting right in front of her. Rik never picked up her phone. I would say in the 15 minutes before she called the police she had to have called for probably 10 times. She knew she owed the money when she loaded the table she should have paid for it then. Howie world was left with nothing left but to call the police to protect themselves. I have never seen someone in my life be so rude to people in a store as this Riki was. Howie world was not rude to her or mean to her. She wanted them to deliver something on a different day and hour before closing. And it simply could not have been done. Riki Did not read her paperwork for the delivery date she messed up and she wanted them to take the blame for it And she drove the other location picked up the merchandise and didn't pay for. You never know who's watching who's going to read these reviews it truly helps to be honest!,0,N3QcinahcFMvE3b1qcmmrw

The pants came back more wrinkled than when I brought them in and they ruined my suit jacket.  It looks like they put the suit jacket in the washer and dryer and now it has permanent little wrinkles all over.  Employees didn't try to fix it and said it would have to wait for the owner and they didn't know when he would show up.  After a day of waiting I took everything to a new cleaner to salvage.

I would rather pay a little more to make sure my clothes come back in one piece.  Not worth it.,2,jGHwrEKNp1_mUatUbV8Hsw

Brady was the only guy there with alot of customers in the office. He met us all in a timely manner and assisted with questions with ease and confidence. I never once felt as if he was too busy for me eventhough he had a pavked lot of people. I test drove two of his suv's he had on the lot and decided right then and there. He ran credit on me and bam we were rolling. Gave me different payment options and scenarios all while staying honest and even standing his ground a little when negotiations came:). I like that about him. It was fair. I got what i wanted at the payment i wanted. Period. No hassel no hidden anything very professional. He even stayed lateer than usual to make sure i was satisfied with my purchase being the night nefore valentines day needless to say his wife im sure wasnt happy about this..lol but he took the wifely lashing so to speak to make sure i was taken care of and happy. Being scared of car dealerships and salesmen..Brady is a glimpse into how my grand daddy use to say car deals went. U go in tell em what u want and they made it happen and u were happy.

We asked for another table and were treated like idiots for even asking such a stupid question. After openly scoffing and scowling at us we got another table. Right next to a group of a dozen 7-8 year olds who had no adult supervision and ran around screaming and throwing shit around the room. We actually pulled our tables back from them to give them more running room. After all this crap the food came out and was  - meh.....

Issue with them is that I told them I needed an item back by a certain day and time and they promised it would be ready. I even allowed 24 hours extra and told them I needed it one day earlier than I did just in case they screwed up.  Showed up 1 day after they promised and guess what? No suit.  I had to wear a dirty suit to the wedding.  They added insult to injury by charging me FULL price for it in spite of their screw up.

I was stuck with them for a few months and they are the worst.  I agree with other reviewers that most of the morons they send out are right out of high school. The guy at my house was either high or retarded.  Probably both. I watched what they do each time they were here and it's a joke. They left trash in my yard.  The reason they are cheap is that they only balance chemicals 2x per month and in the AZ summer that wont work.

I went to get a cut today and it seems to me the consistency for the dedication to quality is not across the board. As a business owner Tony your employees are a direct reflection of you and exuberate your persona. A customer looks for consistency not only in the barber but in the barber shop as well. I asked the employee who cut my hair today to read the shape of my head. It appears this was a difficult task due to the fact that when I got home and looked at the work she had done nearly half of the top portion of my head was cut down to a one!!! The rest of it top portion had some length to it making my head look like it was completely butchered! A cut is suppose to be faded as it moves up to the crown of the head and from there should be well blended. The top of my head looks like a deformity because this person was not paying attention and did not take the time to provide great customer service. A barber should take pride in their work and take their time and know with out a doubt what they are going to do and communicate with the customer so that both parties are on the Same fucking page. How hard is that?! I will no longer be coming here as my confidence is shot in this place after today. I would recommend that you save yourself the trouble of coming here and do the same!!,0,fUax-EYu7F9UpJ7BXXrhmg

I requested a gel manicure and spa pedicure with callous remover. I was very disappointed with my experience. I was there for over 2 hours. My manicurist didn't dry my feet or legs before putting lotion on and didn't provide the full service. The lady next to me had got stones and a nice leg massage... needless to say I did not revive that and my callous is still very visible. My manicure was a complete disaster. My nails were not fully painted and the manager just told me to come back whenever I want to get it fixed. He didn't bother to really take a look or apologize. I will not be refunding.

After reading the reviews we were prepared - they did try to up sell out lobster and king crab. We were specific in what size we wanted and for the most part they complied (only paid about 5 bucks extra for the bigger crab).  They come out with the live lobster and crab to show you and to take photos of your upcoming meal. Quite entertaining watching people take selfies with their lobsters. 

Food was amazing! I love seafood and this really hit the spot. The presentation was really nice. Enjoyed every aspect of the meal.  The fried crab was really good - best part of the meal for sure! We also ordered a few extra dishes to complement all the seafood. We ordered a whole chicken which was good - on the smaller side considering you can go across the street to the supermarket to get a similar one for half the price. The mushroom efu noodle was meh - soggy and sticky. This place definitely has their seafood skills down - wouldn't order their other dishes. 

We had extras so they packed it up and we had lunch for the next day. The service here was not characteristic of typical Chinese restaurants. We had great service with friendly staff coming by to wish my loved one a happy birthday (we had a cake and they volunteered to refrigerate it for us).,0,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

We came here on a Saturday night at around 7 and they were sold out of halibut!! They had just run out so the server had to come and ask us for a new order. So disappointed! I love halibut! We ended up getting haddock and basa instead.  The fish was fresh and flaky and battered perfectly. Chips are great too and coleslaw was yummy. 

Need to come back for the halibut!,0,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

Half star earned only because I had really good service from the waiter and the greeter. They were attentive. 

Food - not good. I had the calamari dinner. Calamari was greasy and I got a number of pieces were the batter was removed from the calamari - not sure if it was on purpose to save on calamari or because the breading stick. 

Rice - small portion. Salad - wilted mess. Potatoes - one quarter piece. Not sure where the rest of them went. 

I couldn't finish my meal. I was disappointed that I paid $20.00+tax for that!,3,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

My most recent experience:  Had a get together with a few of my friends a while back - we came here because it was close to home. 

I had a pasta dish - I'm not sure how an Italian restaurant can mess up the most basic thing: cooking the pasta so that it is no longer raw. Well it happened. I couldn't finish my dish and was quite upset given this is not the first time where I had a disappointing meal here.

My friends had pizza - nothing special. Like someone had mentioned in another review - for the price you pay you you expect to be impressed. 

Needless to say I've given enough chances - won't be coming back here again!,0,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

3454,KQEuEJ80wwPqhRNSI3em4A,1,2014-05-05,0,eNfnyllvw_EoIVJt7kqvXA,2,Appetizer was good - had the deep fried shrimp rolls.

For our mains we had the garlic shrimp and Pad Thai. Neither was impressive. We were especially disappointed with the garlic shrimp - for the price we paid ($10) we expected a much larger portion than the 6-8 pieces we got and a bit more substance than just shrimp and a few pieces of roasted garlic.  We just added it to the pad Thai.

Pad Thai - good thing we ordered something to add to the pad Thai because there wasn't much to it besides noodles.  I think I would have enjoyed standing in line for Thai Express at the local mall food court - that's got better flavour than our meal today.,1,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

The ladies here were super nice and when they found out I was getting married they were so excited to be doing my nails for the big day - and for the honeymoon on the beach. 

I had my finger nails painted the traditional French manicure - I got the shellac done for the first time. I loved it! It lasted for my entire 2 week honeymoon and looked great!

I wanted to go with a hot pink for the toes just for fun - but the lady suggested something more bridal lol! So she did them in silver with sparkles. Very cute. I am glad I took her advice. 

The whole experience took 2 hours they gave me a hand and foot massage as well. I felt nice and relaxed when I left.  Great service!!,0,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

Guacamole was good - other two dips - the corn salsa and spicy bean and smoked queso was meh. Mexican corn was really good. The sauce and spices were yummy!

I had the cod tacos and the Crispy Cotija. Cod taco was good. Cotija not so much.  

I was too stuffed to eat a whole dessert myself so I shared the churros. I didn't enjoy these at all. I much have rather had one of the Sweet Jesus popsicles that my other dinner guests had.

The place is quite small and tends to get busy during prime dinner time. We knew this so we went early and had no problem getting seats. As the evening progressed the lines grew outside. 

Service was friendly and accommodating. We ordered a bunch of stuff for apps and we wanted to share. They're more than happy to bring extra cutlery and plates.

My back and hips have been causing me some painful problems.  I have visited several chiropractors in the valley seeking help.  Dr. Burnett is the only one who has been able to give me long lasting relief.  Her approach is refreshing and effective.  She spends time looking at my whole body and addresses the issues she finds.

Someone things that were working just fine all of a sudden don't when they leave. His response bad luck.

I clearly said NO guacamole on my order and it was smothered everywhere 
I call them back and she tells me there was no guacamole added to which I asked her to explain the green stufff all over. She says bring them back and they will remake them but won't won't start making them until I give the old ones back. Keep I mind I waited nearly 20 min the first time I was there. 
While waiting for the remake they messed up several other orders. 
She gives me the remade order and the cheese was just thrown on there and not melted at all. I ask her to melt the cheese and she throws the styrofoam container in the microwave. 

Other Los Favs locations I'd recommend all day 
The one on Cooper and Warner never again 

And to think they'll be making $10 an hour soon

She was trying to play doctor and she is not a doctor she is a fucking pharmacist.  This women had the audacity to question my family's intent and our doctors education. We have been loyal customers of Walgreens for 15 YEARS!!! I understand their policies and we weren't asking them for special treatment. We were merely asking if it would be possible to get a certain prescription on a certain day because of the holidays. She questions our doctors integrity who has also been our family doctor for 15 years! We usually use a different Walgreens and the reason we were using this location was because the other one didn't have our prescription in stock so they referred us to them. Our other Walgreens knows us by name and they are all very sweet. This pharmacist then begins to insult the other location to us (the CUSTOMER). She also says that our doctor who has been prescribing the same thing for the 15 years is wrong and he shouldn't be prescribing that to us. She said that wouldn't fill our prescription. Feeling so insulted we then proceeded to call the corporate office and they said they would have someone call us that was in our district. They still have not returned our call.

Duanne Askew the electrician was terrific and finished the job off with a fair price as the lights I picked were not the easiest to install.

I sat and waited as other patrons came in and sat down. The owner tended to them and the same waitress brought them their drinks and began to take their orders.

Do you want to pay $382.00 for JUST the REAR BRAKES?!?!?!?  If so this is your place!!!

I am a mechanic and while on a long distance road trip I needed my rear brakes done.  Since I did not have my tools with me I had no choice.  When dropping off the car I asked for them to retain any parts that were replaced so I could look at them because I know mechanics make their money by replacing parts that don't need to be replaced.  

Guess what???  These buggers did exactly that!!!  They replaced both the rear rotors (discs) that did not need replacing.

They said over the phone the rotors mic'ed (micrometer measurement) out less and show .010 less than minimum tolerance  Since I was not there to verify I believed them.

When I picked up the car I visually looked at the old rotors and they looked to be turn-able (can be machined to return to serviceable condition).  I pointed out that cast into the rotor is the words  Minimum thickness .072 inches  I asked for their micrometer and mic'ed out the discs and verified that the lowest thickness of the wear on the worst of the two disc was only .78 inches.  The other one was even thicker... so this means that BOTH DISCS were still within tolerance and could be machined.

So why did they lie to me when they said the discs were .10 less than minimum tolerance when they were still serviceable?

Because they are a RIP OFF and are LI ARS and they take YOUR MONEY by replacing your parts that do not need to be replaced!!!

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!,5,sDofYImMQQmu4Le5G9zmpQ

The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the enforcing of the rules by the teenage lifeguards at the lazy river. They are afraid to tell the guests not to horseplay or run around the lazy river.

Another drawback is that 3 days in a row either the pool or lazy river was completely shutdown due to biohazards which means someone defecated or vomited in the water! Totally gross.,1,E7PoXTT0MVc8xcayikQnsA

Server was just ok. Never checked on us once to refill drinks until we were ready to leave. Probably because we didn't order beer. Wings were excellent. We ordered dry rub with 2 sides of sauce. Hubby's burger (Thick Rick) and fries were delicious - enough for 3 people! STAY AWAY from the Bay of Pigs Cuban pork sandwich. It was nothing like the sandwich described by the PD food editor. Unless you like 80% fat and gristle. It was gross... I'd definitely come back but stick with a burger or chicken sandwich.,1,GvjexZRFBYiqNzOmoKHRTg

I got the chicken schwarma which came with some wilting veggies and layers of sauce. It... Tastes as if the sauce is compensating for the lack of flavour in the chicken. Yes it is cheap and probably a staple. You're not coming here for top shelf food. It's the draw of schwarma on pizza...

Not only did they give great service they were entertaining and fun to talk to! Both Tiana and Jay or T and J ( which is what they told me to call them) addressed me by my first name the entire night instead of sir or Mr which gave very friendly vibes. They made sure my drink was always full and that I was satisfied with everything I ordered. I will definitely be back and am sitting at the bar again even if I had other people with me.

Three days later we picked up the exact car we wanted no hassle what so ever.

I am walking in with   my husband and two kids. Right at the front they tell me i have to leave my stroller behind...are you kidding me... no restaurant has ever ask me to do that before...what if one of my kids was sleeping? i actually  try to time it that way so i can eat a meal in peace.

Since we were all hungry i figured ok lets just stay in.I asked for a booth because it is easier to manage my 3 yr old in there.The waitress gave me a weird look and said that a booth is not available and we can  sit at a regular tabe...why...i do not know...the restaurant wasn't even that busy

.ok so i am getting pretty irritaded by now...i insisted of getting that booth...she gave it to us but with an attitude. I figured it can not get any worst than this lets just enjoy our meal.

As i am getting the menu i ask for the high chair...the waitress tells me she can not give me the high chair because we are sitting in a booth...what?!..i always get a high chair sitting in a booth and it is never a problem and maybe if you didn't take my stroller away i would be able to put my younger child in there.

At this point i asked for a  manager. She tells me how it is dangerous for my son to sit there because it is blocking the waitress to serve the food to our table  and the food is hot...and they are concerned about safety...believe me there was more than enough space 


I was quite upset at this point so she brings me a high chair...the one that you are supposed to strap in to a chair...hello...i can not strap this to anything we are sitting in a booth...am i supposed to sit my 1 yr old child in a high chair that is not straped in into anything...i think that it is pretty dangerous!

Don't ask why but we stayed anyway with me and my child sitting on my lap.

BUT I TOLD MYSELF I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN ...EVER!

It is a waste of a good restaurant...poor management!

I would highly recommend the Promenade location. They have very friendly stuff...stroller no problem...you can sit whetever you like...with a proper high chair...really i have nothing bad to say except that.i am always very pleased with their service and of course that they have yummy yummy food at a reasonable price.,3,XlY6Fm8ercC8yo1r_aqiEA

I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese and found that there was way too much blue cheese. I asked for more buffalo sauce to counter the overpowering blue cheese.

The sweetest lady ever greeted me and asked if I came in from the news (I guess they had a segment earlier this morning). I explained I work close by and had been wanting to try the place out. I ordered my food, which took way too long for my liking. I could definitely tell Ms.Dee normally doesn't do the ordering/ringing up. Then sit and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait for my food. 45 minutes later I receive my food, and they are missing 1 item... so I wait some more. At last, my order is ready! Then I go to pay after I get my food (which is the strangest thing) they would of let me walk out if I hadn't mentioned I never paid yet. Great food, great people, but they need a lot more help in the back. 1 person to cook and 1 person to take orders obviously isn't cutting it. The people ahead of me actually walked out without getting their food. I mean a 45 minute wait when I was the 3rd person in line for a baked potato seems a little strange to me.,0,2A9ox9p8iodBVx20Dhr-fg

 It's a fairly new place & feels like you've found a hidden gem when you walk in.  I won't be surprised if this place is overrun with business in a year's time.

774,VOGC-kA2DlI2kxFj5prkDA,0,2015-06-26,0,MeUWNVQW4pMk_9mkZZ7pFQ,2,I'm mostly reiterating what other have said but with a few additions.

General
- Bad ventilation. With Pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot.
- Wooden walls, so there's not a lot of grip for smearing
= Price for a day pass is reasonable, but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateral.

Bouldering area
+ Decent number of routes and variety
- Stiff trampoline floor. Movable pads are big and effective but they aren't everywhere

Top rope area
-The top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area, which is weird.
- Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +/-. Why not put real YDS ratings?
- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.
- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in San Francisco where I live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating.,3,onagImY8qLOyRGEymXcmRw

This place does serve good food and looks delicious but I am a sauce person and similar to my joy pot I like popcorn chicken with sweet and sour or spicy sauce. Something along the lines with a flavorful taste so I don't just taste the fried chicken breast. 
It may be due to the many Asian fusion places in my area. Living in SGV (San Gabriel Valley), which leaves me to make a drastic opinion based on things that others may not even care for. But overall presentation and quality is pretty good but I would not come back.,2,o865-7pvsMdSEowBbdp-bw

We usually go for chicken tacos, quesadillas (chicken and cheese), patron, AZ, or carne asada burritos. Food is always hot, order always correct.  Food tastes good, not overly salty and definitely bland. It isn't a gourmet meal, but it hits the spot. Prices have gone up a bit but at least they didn't shrink the portions. 

This place stands out for me because no matter how big or 'customized' our order is (e.g. no pico or easy in lettuce, etc.), they've ALWAYS been super patient when taking the order and then super nice when we pick up our food.,0,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ

The lunch menu is a reasonable size for lunch. Eating here you'll be full, but not stuffed. If you want quantity over quality, go to a buffet. The ingredients have been of the best quality, and well prepared.

The fresh salads are well balanced and served with a reasonable amount of dressing - not a vat as would be served elsewhere to tempt you to grossly over-dress your salad.

My wife and I eat vegetarian most of the time, and this is one of our mainstay restaurants for take-out nights. But don't let the 'vegetarian' label scare you off, this is just damn good Indian food by any standard.

Our usual order is the aloo paratha (potato bread), masala dosa (dosa stuffed with spicy potato), and the chana masala (chana dal in a liquidy masala sauce with rice). One order of each of those is enough food to stuff two people, for a total of $18.53+tax+tip. Note that's 1 order of each of those, total, not 1 for each person.

I'm docking one star because the service when you eat in is lacklustre to say the least. Most of the time they don't seem to care whether you get water, take your order in any reasonable time, etc.

But the food is good enough to keep me coming back again and again for take-out.,2,V4YikatszGV5nYAEGf5edw

+  Pet friendlly (we did our homework and found only 4 other hotels near the strip that allow dogs, 2 are extremely expensive).
+  Huge suites!!  Ours was 1,000+ s.f.
+  Heated indoor/outdoor swimming pool & lounge area (the pool was so warm even though it was xmas time) and open long hours (8am to 11pm)
+  Kitchen - very convenient, full size fridge, range, and dishwasher (they even have dish washing liquids, just bring your own sponge)
+  Washer/dryer in the bigger suite
+  Free internet!!  Although their website says you need to pay, at check-in we asked them if they had free internet and they gave us the complimentary login and password.  awesomeness!
+  Big bathroom
+  Non-smoking, non-casino hotel, very peaceful
+  Only about 10 mins. walk to the center of the strip, faster than driving!

Cons:
-  Dusty!  Not sure if it's all of Vegas but I had never noticed so much dust in my room at other hotels before.  
-  Valet parking: kinda inconvenient when you need to get something from your car
-  Sofabed is extremely flimsy, if you have more than 2 people, insist on 2 queen beds.  the sofa cushions are much more comfortable.

Other points:
*  Should call ahead of time to make sure your room have the # of beds you requested when you booked.  (We didn't get our 2 queen beds although we checked in at 2pm.  They were nice enough to switch us to a slightly bigger suite with washer/dryer.)
*  Hotel lobby is extremely small!
*  In-room food service was overpriced (and food was only so-so).  Ask the front desk for a nearby delivery restaurant.  We ordered from there our 2nd night and got a ton of food for 1/2 the price we paid room service!
*  Don't go to the 7-11, it's shady.  You can shop at the am/pm or the Shell food mart across the street.

Overall, it was a good experience for the price we paid ($98).  I would definitely return to this hotel.  I give it a 4.5 stars.,3,DZYGeWwBRKHgLUSk12sCvA

We picked what could have been one of the coldest weekends all winter to visit Montreal, but due to the cozy warmth of our home-away-from-home at the Gault we felt so comfortable!  

The room was lovely, we had a loft basic package and really enjoyed the heated floor and cute door overlooking the street.  The bed is super soft and really a nice complement to the modern look of the room.  There's turn down service and cookies provided daily.  The location of the hotel in Old Montreal could not have been better - it's perfect for walking through the area and very close to the waterfront.

We took part in the spa package offered through the website with the Scandinavian baths and really enjoyed the experience.  Our massages were great and the price was reasonable and cheaper than what we would have paid on our own.

I emailed the concierge ahead of time to request a special wine and snack celebratory surprise for my fiance and they were so helpful.  The entire request was provided to perfection and right on time.  I would highly recommend working with the concierge as the recommendations for dinner and jazz club were completely on-point.

I've given 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple of reasons: the price is still a bit high for what you get, the breakfast is not included in the room rate although we were told it would be upon check in, and the gym is adequate but quite small.,3,gIWWW6w-6P2j-hTH7nantw

We traveled from Post and Ft Apache to Windmill and Durango.  I wish someone had warned me of where the flight would go. The pilot/owner spent 1/2 the time telling jokes, which was good. Unfortunately, the other 1/2 was spent bad mouthing the competitor.  That's not enjoyable.  And talk about HOT.  You need a hat... NEED!  They should set better expectations, an email covering what to bring doesn't cost anything and is just good customer service.  We almost landed on private property, the landing team had to help the basket get over gate.  There were 13 total on the trip including the pilot. It might be legal, but for a comfortable experience, it should be limited to 9.

I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. 
 After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. 
Most sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10 in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4x6. The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.,2,VuQug_nhR6T_kiVIBT2xaA

Say what you will about that corporate beast, but in my opinion, David's Tea has had a firm hand in pushing tea into the hands of mainstream Toronto. So, in a market on its way to becoming pretty heavily saturated, what's Tea Blendz doing to differentiate themselves? Plenty...

First off, it's not a corporate beast. It's a little boutique shop owned by Khadija, an incredibly nice person whose passion for all things tea-related is almost contagious. That feeling of non-corporateness runs throughout the experience at Tea Blendz. Khadija is easily approachable, encourages you to ask questions, and is obviously passionate about the stuff she's selling. Not to say that the staff at those corporate places aren't passionate, but at Tea Blendz, it just seemed more honest.

They also have a pretty kick-ass teaspresso machine--one of the only ones in Toronto right now I'm told. Basically, it allows them to quick-press loose-leaf tea rather then steep it. That means you can get it faster and cleaner, and the whole process is under more control of the brewer rather than being at the mercy of the boiling water. Your tea will still take a few minutes, but those few minutes can easily be spent talking to the warm and pleasant staff. In fact, I ended up staying and chatting about tea and the neighbourhood for far longer than those few minutes that my tea was pressed.

Using the teaspresso machine, Tea Blendz also brews up some pretty amazing tea lattes. Khadija claimed they were the best in the city, and I can't say I'd disagree with her. While I'm self-admittedly not a tea or tea latte expert by any means, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I could definitely see myself going out of my way to enjoy another one.

Khadija works with local tea blenders to come up with a lot of her blends. They have plenty of classic flavours, like Earl Grey, English Breakfast, and Bourbon Street Vanilla, and some of that are hers and the blenders creation, like Chocolate Mint Delight, Root Beer Rooibos, and Sweet Pumpkin Spice. Despite being pressed and not steeped, the subtle flavours that the tea descriptions promised were still prevalent. I also picked up on a slight sweetness, which amazingly highlighted the even subtler flavours in the tea. All-in-all, I'd sort of equate it to wine-tasting; after tasting it, discussing the tea and its flavours seemed almost natural.

Khadija mentioned that there's a growing trend in food and tea pairing. Because of that, I wondered if she planned on offering any food at some point, which right now she doesn't. I don't mean sitting down and eating a club sandwich and fries, but a small, one-bite of something that was specifically made just to be paired with a particular tea would certainly have been interesting. But Tea Blendz just opened a month ago, so things aren't yet set in stone.

All-in-all, I had a great chat with Khadija. I learned some stuff, and I even left with a few bags of tea. I brought home a bag of Chocolate Mint Delight and the Sweet Pumpkin Spice, and at 5 bucks for 50 grams, I left feeling pretty good about buying it.

So if you're in the neighbourhood, this honest-to-goodness, non-corporate boutique shop is definitely worth checking out and supporting. Even if you're not in the neighbourhood, it's worth the drive if you want to learn more about tea and if you appreciate truly nice customer service.,6,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

I think it didn't help that one of the members of counter staff left right as I got to her station, so I stood there an extra 5 or 6 minutes waiting for someone further down the chain to realize... oh nothing is happening.

The one of the things I did like was the tortilla chips with the hint of lime and the fresh pico.

Maybe I had a bad experience, maybe I've just had really amazing Mexican food, maybe I should try them again, or maybe I should just try a different location.,3,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ

The driver who eventually picked us up at SFO (after me calling seven times asking where the driver was - and the answer always being 5 minutes) never said a word, never apologized. Picking up other passengers we learned that they had waited even longer - one for TWO HOURS! The drivers going both ways were both reckless and my wife likened it to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

Only gripes for this place are that you can expect to wait a while for a table and they do not take reservations. Second, when it gets busy the service can be slightly spotty and it seemed to take a while to get our food.

It was just weird and uncomfortable. Another guest asked for help in getting drinks ordered, and no one would respond.

4548,lsxbnkAD5DZ4SuVPrFx39A,0,2010-12-15,0,NyFCY7suqmtTQvROO66yRw,4,Living in the Junction and relying on transit can make for a lack of choices when it comes to food, particularly stuff that's considered artisanal. While that may have been true a few years ago, boy-oh-boy, the times are changing. Those of us living in the neighbourhood awhile have seen its dynamic (albeit slow) change, particularly when it comes to food; but in the Junction's ever-expanding food landscape, a few places are setting the stage. Enter the Junction Fromagerie.

Junction Fromagerie is sitting non-coincidentally right next to Delight, a chocolate shop that's perhaps known in the neighbourhood more for their ice cream than their handmade chocolate. Both Delight and Junction Fromagerie are brain-childs of the same people, Jennifer Rashleigh & Jeff Brown, and the association is obvious as far as quality goes. While Delight doesn't have any cheese, they do have a uniquely flavoured and way-better-than-it-sounds Quebec blue cheese ice cream. Soft and creamy with an exacting amount of high-quality blue cheese, it's obviously well crafted and surprisingly tasty.

What makes the Junction Fromagerie different from the handful of other cheese specialty shops in Toronto is their strict direction to Canadian products; they only carry Canadian cheeses, local and artisanal mind you, but Canadian nonetheless. They're also particularly partial to Ontario cheeses. Their in-house made butter, crackers, and croustinis, in conjunction with those small-batch and locally sourced cheeses, make them a worthy underdog in an increasingly competitive business.

The Junction Fromagerie brings with it some old-world charm, and at first walk-in, you may mistake it for a boutique fromage on a quiet Paris street. Big-frame bay window and a creaky wood-laid floor set the space. Besides that, the whole store is fairly nondescript other than the front case brightly displaying their cheeses.

Don't know your Comtomme from your Bleu de la Moutonndere? No worries! Not only is the staff knowledgeable and the cheese labeled and explained, but the Junction Fromagerie also offers cheese tastings and pairings that not only teach you about the cheese they carry, but also inspire you to be a bit more adventurous in your cheese selections. Although these tastings aren't a regularly occurring event, they do happen. Their Stone's Throw Cheese and WIne Pairing event, which was created with the folks at Stone's Throw Winery, sold out super quick.

The appearance of Junction Fromagerie signals more than just beautiful cheese being available in the Junction. It also serves as an important reminder that when it comes to food, the Junction is fast becoming a neighbourhood that is known for quality.,4,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

Not so con: Frango no Churrasco
Cons: Bacalhau, parking lot, waitress service, no free Wi-Fi

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No

On Thursday around 7:00pm, me and my wife went to the restaurant to have our dinner and we faced the first negative point, the parking lot. The parking lot was not enough to accommodate all the people to the restaurant because it is shared with other stores around. So, it was not hard, but it was easy to notice there was not enough space for everyone. At least, we did not need to wait so much time to sit.

The table was clean, but there was an old newspaper below my table and I noticed that the floor was not totally clean. On a first moment, I thought that the waitress service was nice, but after we placed the order, we got forgotten. My soda glass was empty for a long time and the waitress never comes back asking if I wanted more. But the rolls were delicious, unfortunately, what I cannot say about the Frango no Churrasco and the Bacalhau that me and my wife asked.

Overall, it was frustrating for asking the two items that were house specialties and eat a food with poor quality. The Bacalhau was under seasoned and burned plus the potatoes were blend too. My Frango no Churrasco, the chicken was almost very good, the rice and potatoes were almost cold. It seems that the food was released for a time and they forgot there. But the worst for me was having a bad Bacalhau on a Portuguese restaurant. It is a very bad sign. I don't plan to come back again to it and if you are looking for a Portuguese restaurant, I recommend looking for other. There are a plenty around the Greater Toronto Area.,0,95KCaXFJEGla4AK7ETBmWw

It's not too expensive - considering the quality. I tend to avoid the food though, since it seems quite over priced for what they are offering. Something like $8.00 for a grilled cheese? I've had them and they're great, but maybe not $8.00 kind of great. 

The tea is great though. The matcha is the best in the neighbourhood and the staff is exceptional. Always a pleasant time here.,0,SL7flTbdIekoh9_1iHhxyA

Well apparently that didn't matter because we ended up waiting 2 hours just to see the doctor. Then we had to wait another half hour for the vaccines. 

The doctor was nice when we finally saw him. Gave us good information for our trip. Good news is we didn't get sick on the trip! 

We had another trip planned recently and decided to come back for a prescription for some more medication.  Again we made an appointment, perhaps it was an anomaly last time for having to wait so long. Nope. It was 2 hours again. 

It took them about 20 minutes to find my husbands file alone. Apparently it was misfiled.  

And this time what really frustrated me was that some people just walked in with no appointment and were seen first. My guess is because they were paying for their consultation were as we were just going for a prescription. 

Completely frustrating experience - next time I may try another clinic because this one clearly is understaffed and disorganized.,3,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

Tucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.  

I was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the what it is.  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!

While the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure.,3,OQT9DjfBrzrwOEdVJjuYIA

Things didn't start out so good...the manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didn't want to split the checks! After we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?) he left for a bit, and then came back and said we could split the check. So, I believe they were just being lazy, since they ended up splitting the check anyway. If they had wanted us to pay with cash, they should have informed us when we made the reservations! Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident. 

Moving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. 

Bottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip.,0,dNNhk8urecrV_otn7kiziA

Our food came out and we ordered calamari, margherita pizza, Italian sausage pizza and some raviolis. The calamari was the only thing that was good and warm. I really liked the pesto sauce that they came with! But the margherita pizza was cold and lacked flavor, other pizza was cold and the raviolis were rubbery. Worst of all with this meal were my drinks. The water that they gave us when we first got there had a funny taste like the glass hadn't been washed or the ice that was in it was really old and had sat in a freezer too long.

I even dropped by few times to make sure what I saw during our tour was what you'd actually get.  The site is very well maintained and extremely clean.  

The meals and snacks are carefully planned by a nutritionists who incorporate diverse menu (fish, tofu, various ethnic menus like pad thai) that incorporates seasonal veggies and fruits.  

I cannot say enough about the staff though - they truly love what they do and it shows.  From the day we started transitioning my little one at 12 months, all the teachers have shown nothing but love and care.  They make sure each child is engaged and cared for and I am always grateful for all the work that they do with the children.  

The webcam access to the room is also a bonus (it came really handy during the first few weeks when it was just as much of a transition period for me as it was for my child - I may have spent a good chunk of my day watching/weeping/laughing).

Another added bonus is how responsive the head-office is to suggestions.  Parents are encouraged to give feedback and suggestions and they are very responsive to parents' inputs.  The weekly newsletter also allows us to know what my little one has been learning so that we can reinforce some of the things at home (ex. songs or books that they have been learning).

Cons: I did not found

Parking space: Enough for all customers
Good for big groups: Yes

On a Good Friday around 2:00 PM, the restaurant was almost empty probably because the city was empty too. Said that, we could select any place to sit and wait for our food. The place is very clean and the menu was not fancy enough and offers any kind of food for different levels of taste.
The waitress was a very nice and friendly person. She was always aware when my soda needs refill. The place is very clean and calm. It is a very nice place to have a business dinner or just a quiet place to eat. This time, my wife and I decided to eat a Cesar Salad with Chicken and a Malaysian Chicken Curry. Where both food presentations makes me wanting to eat them with the eyes.
Overall, it was a very nice experience. I never thought that a coconut flavored food could be so good. Just as a personal touch, the only thing that I could change is cutting the chicken in pieces instead of having the whole chicken breast there. But, is how I said, it is only a personal touch. It is not something that made my experience worst. I left the restaurant with the feeling that I want to back again many more times.,0,95KCaXFJEGla4AK7ETBmWw

I can't recall for certain the name of our favorite roll, but I believe it was the Glendale roll. Deep fried goodness is all I can say! I know, it isn't traditional sushi, but I just can't do raw fish! Nuff said. We tried two other kinds which were good as well, but the deep fried goodness overshadowed the other ones and I have erased them from my memory. 

The pot stickers were ok, not fabulous. The green tea was great and came in cute little tea pots. I haven't had sake here and I don't know why, since I usually get sake. Guess I'd better head back for some more sake and sushi!,0,dNNhk8urecrV_otn7kiziA

So finally with sometime on my hands me and my wife stopped in. The menu was full of things I wanted to try all at once but I finally went with the Souvlaki Platter and my wife ordered the Baked Ziti, the prices were very reasonable and I was greatly impressed for how small the resturant is. My greek salad was fresh even for it being late at night and my marinated pork was so delicious that my tongue smacked my brains for not stopping before. My wife's ziti was obviously good cause she was giving it praises like no other lol, no to mention the portions were very hefty. The experience wouldnt have been excellent if it wouldn't have been for the ever forgetful waitress. Highly recommonded.,2,u1yV4xRUwNxv150qyZKTxQ

Food came out ok, when the check came out, I advised my waiter my host at Venetian will take care of the bill and they had forwarded the comp to Casanova's computer. My waiter walked to the back, talked to someone and came out telling me that comps only work for lunch and dinner, not breakfast. Uhhhhh......wth? Since when were comps allowed only for certain times. I called my host, my host told me that its weird, it's supposed to work anytime. I told him i wanna speak to the manager, and he showed me to someone named Maria, i told her the situation and she said they never got the comp from my host, and even if they did, it only works for lunch and dinner. I called my host again, and told my host to speak with Maria, Maria told my host they never received the voucher, guess what happens....... she then said their system is down so they never got it. So i told them you know what, forget it, i'll pay for it. So i paid.

I was waiting around 30 minutes for them, then she tells me their damn system was down? Really? It took that long? Such pathetic service, my host had to tell guest services to walk the voucher up to them.

This is a past experience review. On Thanksgiving Day around 8:30PM, we did not have so much effort to find a place to leave our car there. The hostess was very friendly and nice and directed us to our table without any need for waiting. Obviously the restaurant was almost empty due to the holiday.
The dining room was huge and there is a sundae bar that we got very tempted to eat there after the dinner. The waitress was very nice and friendly and was always checking our table to see if we needed something more. Because we were craving for a burger, my wife and I decided to build our own burger.
Overall, the experience was fantastic! The burger was big and juice and not greasy and the fries were delicious too. This is the type of restaurant that I will have as a first option when I go back to the Pittsburgh, PA again.,1,95KCaXFJEGla4AK7ETBmWw

When my now-husband and I found out that we could get married at Denny's we decided that we had to do it.  I received excellent service once I was put in touch with Sheila, the manager.  She explained to me what I options I could choose from and we went from there.  In the beginning, we had chosen the cheapest option, but we were upgraded because we had a special guest musician perform for us.  The upgrades were great!  The flower bouquet and boutonniere was so pretty!!!  The cake pops were delicious and the set up looked great!  We had also wanted an Elvis minister, so they put us in touch with one and he was fantastic!!

While standing in the area by the spring water, my 2yo was fussing. I noticed a customer and the cashier looking at us. The customer shook her head and turned back to the cashier and made a motion with her hand smacking her lips. The cashier laughed and made a motion cupping one hand and back hand smacking the cupped hand with his other hand. They looked at us again and the customer kept talking while she was frowned up. 

I went to them and said I know you're not implying I smack my child. They just looked; the customer still frowned up. As I walked away my friend still stood there and said they kept looking at us while making comments. 

After this we spoke with the supervisor who claimed she was the highest in rank there. She seemed to not care because she said I'll talk to him nonchalantly. She said I could go online to get in touch with the corporate office since I wasn't satisfied with her response. She also gave us a card and pen to fill out with comments about the store only to later come back and say she needed the pen back because that was the only one they had. 

Before leaving we talked with a cashier who pointed out the manager to us. Then the cashier who was making the motions with his hands came to where we were and started talking to us saying he has a 5yo so he knows how children act up. Obviously the supervision said something to him. He had an attitude and said he wouldn't be talking to a customer about another customer and we had mistaken the whole thing. 

Once leaving we talked to the manager about the hand gestures the cashier and customer made. He said he's worked with the cashier for years and he wouldn't do anything like that. He claimed the cashier smacks his hands a lot while talking and that when he came over to us told he apologized for his hand gestures. I told the manager our conversation was over because the cashier never mentioned anything about his hand gestures and only had excuses, not an apology. 

It's nice to know that the Whole Foods staff sticks together no matter what from the top on down. I will find out if Corporate sticks by this kind of foolishness. 

Oh... Before I left I saw the cashier pushing the supervisors cart to her car and they were chatting it up for a while.,2,MmOlteGoOLp4uydXpW7EHg

He gives me hope when sometimes I don't have it. He helps me to believe everything is going to work out. He treats you like a friend not a criminal, yes if you mess up he's gonna get you like Ru Paul says dont fuck it up, you treat him like he treats you, you get the awesome blessed Dignity Bail Bonds experience.

4803,BBkQ99cFPNJ5op-7IVqWNA,0,2012-06-21,0,zsWPtFSRkrQYMP1NUWcMqw,1,I have been to elements three times; the first time was excellent, the second time was good enough, and the third time was so awful I feel the need to ward off anyone else from visiting this restaurant.

We had two good experiences with elements, so when we saw a groupon for a four-course tasting menu, we bought it without hesitation.  Side note: our first excellent experience included the tasting menu. He ordered the four course, while I ordered a salad and entree.  His four courses were full of delicious food that was enough to feed us both.  Neither of us were able to finish our meals, and we left full and happy!  But tonight, our tasting menu options and delivery were beyond disappointing.

We decided to sit at the bar tonight.  When we sat down we were eyed down by the female bartender who reluctantly took our order.  She didn't bother to tell us the specials, which we later overheard her share with other customers, and she didn't ask if we were interested in any food.  Before we were finished with our drinks, she brought over our check; were we being rushed out of this NOT crowded bar?  I had a bad feeling, and I wish I would have trusted my gut to leave.  We asked her for another round and let her know we were going to order dinner and had a groupon.

Our service was bad before we told her we had a groupon, and it only spiraled down from there.  But bad service I can handle, it was the food that made me jump onto yelp!  The tasting menu was for family style service so we had to pick the same four items for dinner.  Family style?  This is different than last time, I thought.... Our first course was a variety of meats, cheeses, and olives.  It was a much smaller portion than he had during our first visit to elements, but who needs to over eat meat and cheese anyway?  The second course was a beat and goat cheese salad.  The salad was large and more than enough for two people (aka filler).  When our entree arrived I almost fell off of my barstool.  There was one filet of salmon for the two of us to share.  It wasn't a monstrous sized salmon as big as my head, it wasn't two of my fists, it was a small piece of salmon meant to feed both of us.  I am mortified that I didn't call attention to this at the restaurant, but I couldn't believe that I had been served a 'family style' portion of salmon that included only one piece of fish.  WHAT?  Dessert wasn't memorable, but what I do remember is not being asked if I wanted coffee to accompany it either.

I'm not even mentioning in detail the bartender's awkward comments that we cleaned our plates during our meal or that another bartender knocked over my glass of wine. Please, don't go to elements.  There are too many better restaurants in Pittsburgh to waste anymore thought on this dump.


Note to restaurants: If you don't like people who use groupons, then please don't invite us into your restaurant only to treat us poorly. Like I said earlier, this was our third visit to Elements.  We bought the groupon because we were repeat customers, we liked the restaurant, and now we will never go back.

**UPDATE**
I followed up with Groupon and Elements.  Groupon refunded our money with no problem at all.  When I called Elements, they said the owner wanted to speak to me after reading my review on yelp, but he wasn't available.  He called me back once, and I returned the call.  I haven't heard back anything.,0,nZpcyQaEQzvUpnbjK0cQIg

I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt oops then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say that's not almond uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says hurry up now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right. As a bonus not even two weeks later I had a nail break off, ridiculous.,6,ykP8KSxQJzg5akl05KXcVw

I like that incoming livestock are kept in quarantine after arriving, that I can ask to be told when a particular species becomes available, that the staff are so knowledgeable and enjoy discussing the hobby, even though I notice some impatient shoppers just wanting to grab and go. 

Reminds me of the now closed Pirrhana on Avenue Road that was run by a hobbyist, or Fintastic in the east end run by Mike.

Harold the head guy has saved a couple ailing fish with clear advice.

I'm a Chicagoan so I've had many many extremely expensive hair services done in the past and Modern Salon is less expensive than what I've had before and offers better service as well.

These were not uncommon responses from folks when I said I'd be heading to Live Food Bar. I too was skeptical but went along for the ride anyways when a friend suggested we go. While perusing the online menu, I was genuinely stumped as to what I would get. I already eat at least one - but generally several - vegetarian meals a week, so I'm not opposed to eating a meal with no meat. But Live is a vegan, organic restaurant that features recipes without gluten, without sugar and certainly without any animal products which is outside my culinary experience. If you happen to feel the same way, I suggest you go with an open mind as Live has an excellent reputation and it is well earned. 

I settled in to the table at the front, which has a great view of the world walking by, of the bright, cheerful restaurant. While I waited for my dining companions, I had a look through the drink list and eventually settled on a bottle Mill Street Organic. (Should I come back in the summer, I will definitely sample the cocktails on the lovely patio!) When the ladies arrived, we ordered a bottle of organic cabernet sauvignon and started going over the menu for the millionth time. It is an extensive list with dishes that should appeal to just about all diners. Appetizers, salads, bowls, mains, pasta, dessert: Live certainly does not lack for choice. The three of us agreed that we wanted to try the chick pea fries, so we ordered those while attempting to make a decision.

Finally, we made our choices: raw sushi with pumpkin & sunflower seed nori rolls and a detox salad; Bacon Cheese burger; and tempeh cakes with a warm corn, avocado and white wine salsa. Orders placed, we tucked into our wine and the chick pea fries which arrived shortly thereafter. Crispy on the outside, piping hot and soft on the inside, this non-traditional take on a staple hit the spot, especially with the homemade BBQ sauce on the side.

Our mains arrived in a timely manner, and we hungrily tucked in to them. The sushi roll had a great combination of flavour and texture. I was a little jealous of not ordering that one for myself, but my giant plate of food was more than enough. The tempeh (an Indonesian soybean product) cakes were piled high on top of the wonderful salsa that was accompanied by a spicy chipotle aioli. If you're hungry, get this dish. It was undoubtedly for the best that I did not order an appetizer, as well as the cakes and sides were so surprisingly good that I was nearly scraping my plate. 

As for the cheese bacon burger, it passed the taste test. The patty consisted of chick peas and had macadamia cheddar cheese and eggplant bacon. I can see your eyebrows raising. The eggplant had a smoky flavour and was quite good, though certainly not bacon. The cheese in question was a bit of a head-scratcher, though not unpleasant. The gluten-free bun was nicely toasted and the BBQ sauce was a great touch.

Since we had already gone through much of the menu, we thought we should give dessert a whirl. All the desserts are kept on display in near the back of the restaurant, and there is quite an array from which to choose. We opted for two: the tiramisu and the Black Forrest cake. Now, my Italian friends would be horrified to find a tiramisu without real cream, but it really was quite good with a strong, but not overpowering, taste of espresso. Similarly, the Black Forrest cake was rich, creamy and cut nicely with the cherries on top. No complaints - I certainly didn't feel like I was missing out.

Live has a great vibe to it and customers were constantly arriving either to have a seated meal or to pick up their take-out orders. The music is at just the right volume and the staff is friendly and accommodating. We were there for several hours and never felt rushed, nor got the idea that we were no longer welcome. Food arrives promptly and with a smile, water bottles are refilled, and the service is relaxed. So take your vegetarian friends, take your carnivorous friends: they will likely all be satisfied. The portions are well-sized and, most importantly, the food is delicious.,0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

I would suggest the appetizer sampler (the works). As many below me will agree, the sauerkraut balls are delicious. The bier cheese & pretzels were good too.

I had the Bayerischer Schweinsbraten (pork with sauerkraut and a potato dumpling). It was different than I expected as I'm not too familiar with German food, but still pretty good. The pork was cooked well and had a good sauce. I wish I had substituted mashed potatoes instead of the dumpling.,0,djSJ6a9gsLSdj-7BoyNNQA

The lap cheung waffle was an interesting mix of sweet and savoury. There was no line up when we went at night and the waffle was made well. Not underdone or overdone.

Our server was very attentive and knew the menu very well. She was able to offer many suggestions. The rest of the wait staff was also helpful when it came to seating us, turning the air down, everything.

Served tapas style, the food is conducive to sharing and ordering lots of little things. We tried for all ranges of the menu and thought the dishes had interesting flavor profiles, were prepared well, and tasted great.

The seviche section allows you to choose a fish and a style of preparation -- they are delicious! The filet mignon was also a wonderful cut of meat.

115,VhQXJteVrG3L-wq8HlYFqw,1,2012-01-13,0,0RqkBJegJpH7thxPTL30NA,4,I am the first to admit that I don't know Roncesvalles Village well. A friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer. In recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining Roncesvalles Ave has drawn me to the West side of the city more frequently. I never know quite what to expect when I arrive, but I am always pleasantly surprised.

One such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the décor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.
My friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.

We submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a Christmas burger the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. 

Also sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. 

If you're at The Ace, do not miss the fried chicken, which is succulent, juicy and crispy, served with him gravy, collard greens and cornbread (though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me, as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while). The fresh pasta with tuna, chiles, plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes, radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature, texture and flavor. 
No matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!

By the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch. You won't be disappointed.,2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

I did a ton of research and talking to people about the best pool company in our area.  Hands down, Presidential was the top recommendation.  We met with John at the Gilbert location and he was very patient with us.  We had an idea on our pool design but had no idea at all on costs.  We explained this and he patiently designed our pool and all the bells and whistles.  Obviously it came back way over what we could afford.  But John didn't give us any attitude at all.  We were even in his office right before they were closing and he didn't shoo us out the door.  We ended up taking the quote home and sitting on it for a month.  When we finally came back, John was eager to help us redesign something that we could be proud of.  And we did!!

When our project kicked off, our project manager, David, and John met with us at home and walked us through the entire process.  They even had this cool little website where we could track dates and milestones.  Once it got started, it went very quickly!  Our only delays were because of the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.. and the rain.. oh the rain).  And of course, I had soooo many questions.  David was always very responsive and easy to contact.  

At the end of our project, we scheduled an appointment with Jason and he walked us through the phone app to control our pool (yep, there's an app for that) and all the controls on our pool system.  He went step by step on the chemicals needed to keep our pool balanced.  After a week of owning our pool, I feel very comfortable being able to maintain our pool myself because of all the information Jason provided us.,9,QkO16gr4QaPaKPWeUTAEqA

I like the long hours the gym provides for daycare. And daycare will change dirty diapers!!! And for the most part I really do like the gym daycare employees (except I had an experience where the daycare manager was extremely rude, but I forgave that one instance because I figured she was having a bad day).

I also enjoy the towel service. & The equipment is great. The classes seem great though I have yet to attend a class. 

But I wish the gym would add free wifi for members to use while working out (so that I can watch netflix while working out), add some more channels to the equipment's tvs (I wish they would add e, bravo, mtv) and add a laundry shoot for towels inside the locker rooms. I even put in a request for the laundry shoot but Mountainside obviously just ignored my request. 

I also wish this location & all other locations would have a water service that they provide in their Scottsdale location. It seems like the west valley is constantly getting the short end of the stick and this is another example of that isn't it? & might be wrong but I think the Scottsdale location also has better tv channels than the Surprise gym does.

But despite those gripes I'm still a fan. This is the best gym in Surprise.,4,WgbbxTRIy7MwDKn7nL5WKQ

I did my research with a good number of home inspectors and it was just obvious when calling them they give you the marketing pitch trying to appease you. When I called Bill he was straight up, and the real deal.

I am a buyer who was looking for a new home to live in. I had some unfortunate circumstances arise on my home inspections and Bill went above and beyond in his service to accommodate my situations because he really does care. 

His inspections are thorough and accurate. He finds everything that can be a problem with the house. Trust me I did more than one inspection with him. It's pretty crazy if you join him in the inspection to see how good he is. 

I thank Bill for the professionalism and quality of service that he has provided me. I will definitely recommend him to everyone and use him again if I need to do a home inspection.

My boyfriend and I have a 5-month old German Shepherd puppy who has been and currently attends training, playtime, and grooming sessions here. 

Training: Matt, the owner of Romp, instructs all the training classes and we could not be happier with his training with kindness method. There are many ideas about what German Shepherds should be and do act like, but both my boyfriend and I found it truly important to make him the sweetest dog possible. We do not want a robot dog that loses all personality because of training via being broken. Romp exceeds our expectations every time with this regard as, while learning to be obedient for safety and fun, our puppy grows his personality each and every week! It is amazingly spectacular! 

Playtime: Matt's highly professional and super caring staff always make our puppy feel loved and missed every week. It is almost like its his second home here, where all his friends live too. We absolutely love receiving his report cards at the end of each playtime, telling us what his pawsonality, what his favorite activity, who his best friend, and any room of impruffment was that day. FYI...he's a straight A student so never any room for impruffment here, but the staff will let you know if you need to work on something with your dog. Our puppy adores these play sessions and comes back exhausted from his long day of fun. I do have to say that I always speak to Savanna and she is the best! 

Grooming: Amanda always makes him look so cute! She really does a terrific job and has over 20 years of experience! What more can you ask for than that? Our German Shepherd puppy is extremely unique that loves being clean and looking his best, but tends to oppose being brushed and groomed at home. Somehow, I still do not know how!, Amanda gets him to not only tolerate these activities, but to want to be brushed and groomed all day long! It is so strange, but I am super grateful to her for her sixth sense!

Every where we go and everyone who interacts with our puppy always says how well behaved and what an outstanding temperament he has and it is in huge part due to Matt and his A team at Romp!

All in all, if you have a dog and have not taken him or her to Romp, you are doing a tremendous disservice to yourself and your pup. In other words, you would be crazy not to try this place! I can go on and on. 

Thank you Romp!,3,25L-grqw8r5VqnXYrYxUdQ

I recommend getting here early and be prepared to wait if you have a big party. I like their Shoyu ramen, the gyoza was ok. I thought for $5.00 it was a bit steep. I will visit again although I am not a big fan of MSG which I know for sure they have in their broth.,0,qr9hmaIxq1z9ycgT28PpRw
4886,a8ECAeXMEEUeCidS7vvCyg,2,2010-10-14,1,Mmbxv1SIZp2nQniivcfbYg,1,I was happy to see that  this mall has this restaurant because it is one of my favorite places to eat. I usually go to the Promenade location....and very happy there but Vaughn Mills its a totally differrnt story....
I am walking in with   my husband and two kids. Right at the front they tell me i have to leave my stroller behind...are you kidding me... no restaurant has ever ask me to do that before...what if one of my kids was sleeping? i actually  try to time it that way so i can eat a meal in peace.

Since we were all hungry i figured ok lets just stay in.I asked for a booth because it is easier to manage my 3 yr old in there.The waitress gave me a weird look and said that a booth is not available and we can  sit at a regular tabe...why...i do not know...the restaurant wasn't even that busy

.ok so i am getting pretty irritaded by now...i insisted of getting that booth...she gave it to us but with an attitude. I figured it can not get any worst than this lets just enjoy our meal.

As i am getting the menu i ask for the high chair...the waitress tells me she can not give me the high chair because we are sitting in a booth...what?!..i always get a high chair sitting in a booth and it is never a problem and maybe if you didn't take my stroller away i would be able to put my younger child in there.

At this point i asked for a  manager. She tells me how it is dangerous for my son to sit there because it is blocking the waitress to serve the food to our table  and the food is hot...and they are concerned about safety...believe me there was more than enough space 


I was quite upset at this point so she brings me a high chair...the one that you are supposed to strap in to a chair...hello...i can not strap this to anything we are sitting in a booth...am i supposed to sit my 1 yr old child in a high chair that is not straped in into anything...i think that it is pretty dangerous!

Don't ask why but we stayed anyway with me and my child sitting on my lap.

BUT I TOLD MYSELF I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN ...EVER!

It is a waste of a good restaurant...poor management!

I would highly recommend the Promenade location. They have very friendly stuff...stroller no problem...you can sit whetever you like...with a proper high chair...really i have nothing bad to say except that.i am always very pleased with their service and of course that they have yummy yummy food at a reasonable price.,3,XlY6Fm8ercC8yo1r_aqiEA
155,vOUIiRfyA9jtra7Hez6mpg,0,2012-01-13,0,Mk_ZW9-ol4mFr9HMvjQmiQ,3,Wanting to try something new, and looking for a cool place to go for pre-Yuk-Yuks dinner and drinks, my friend and I decided to try out Everest Restaurant on Queen West.

What seemed to be a quiet Saturday evening when we first arrived at 7pm, quickly turned into a fairly busy club like dining experience. And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching, and MuchMusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.

I was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme, something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks, and hoping to find a new go-to place for a fun and creative meal. I secured reservations before our arrival, however, we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception, waved to an area in the front of the room, and told I could sit wherever I wanted. Unorthodox, maybe, but sit we did!
Putting the hostesses' indifference behind us, we decided to delve straight into the wine menu, and with a little help from our server, selected the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knights Valley, a California vintage from 2009 for about $40. The wine was excellent, and I found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the list.

The dinner menu ($15-$20) presents a somewhat more challenging predicament. Filled with Tibetan and Indian dishes, along side the same old North American stand-by of pasta and sandwiches, I found myself unsure if this was a Tibetan restaurant, or your average Italian eatery all dressed up. It's not that I mind an eclectic menu, in fact I appreciate one, however when venturing out to try a new type of cuisine (in this case, Tibetan), one wants to be sure that the restaurant is absolutely committed to their craft, and have their specialty cuisine down pat. Thus, I was unsure of whether venturing into the momas (Tibetan dumplings) and sha-momo (spinach and beef), or the fettuccine alfredo was the better option.

After some quality deliberation between the Tibet/North America paradox, I decided to try a platter, a mix of several different Tibetan style foods, to allow myself to experience as much of the cuisine as possible. The menu seemed heavy on potatoes, stewed meats and rice, so I decided to try almost all of the above. The stewed potatoes were good, cooked just right, but tasted much like something I could make at home, no real special spice or flavour that made me feel like I was trying something exotic. The rice was cooked with raisins, which just didn't do it for me, and was a little bland.  My meal was served with steamed Tibetan vegetables (broccoli and carrots), which aside from not seeming exceptionally Tibetan to me, were surprisingly good. An interesting side note, both of our meals were served with naan bread, which really was just pita bread from my estimation. Overall, I was fairly underwhelmed by my choice. My friend ordered the butter chicken on rice with naan bread (same problem), and said that she enjoyed her meal. The butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me, so that must be a good thing, but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving Indian food. 

While I thoroughly enjoyed Everest restaurant for its attention to the design décor and ambience, I was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into Tibetan food. I think the next time we decide to go out for Tibetan style cuisine, we will try Little Tibet further down Queen Street.,0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA
3432,F_oPMHJrH42R67xp5eKtQA,0,2014-10-13,0,1Rch84fqimlhcUaaJaMkPg,3,It was quite busy for a mid week evening. I was shocked actually - all the tables were full, and there were people waiting for seats.  Only one server was working and the chef was by herself cooking everything for the restaurant, so it was quite chaotic. We forgave them when the server brought over something we did not order. It was similar enough so we kept it (shrimp tempura vs veggie tempura).  After the rush, the service did improve. You can tell they were stressed back in the kitchen. 

I came here with a large group and we decided to share about 10 dishes among all of us. Really liked the bibimbap! The complementary side dishes was nothing special. But what did stand out was the green pancake/crepe they sent over. So good we ended up ordering another!

4571,PzxaySdQuhULRTXhWwM8Kg,0,2011-05-17,0,1hkQ5og5pirju4ZrZqsg9Q,5,Man. This whole area is pretty packed with coffee shops and the like. Just up the road in The Junction, there's Crema, The Good Neighbour, and a Starbucks; just down the road in Roncys, there's Alternative Grounds, Coffee and All that Jazz, and yet another Starbucks. And that's just to name a few... The neighbourhood, it seems, is littered with coffee shops. So how does Hula Girl stack up against all the rest of them? Really, really nicely.

Hula Girl isn't just another boring-old coffee shop; they're an 'espresso boutique', and they focus their boutique-ish expertise on blends of Kona coffee beans and turning those blends of beans into near-perfect cups of espresso. The owners are clearly not only passionate about coffee, but knowledgeable about it too; it becomes blatantly obvious with the first sip. The espresso is noticeably balanced and brewed with a high-level of skill. Simply put, they have some truly nice people that are dam good at pulling espressos standing behind their shiny brewing machine.

No worries if espresso isn't your thing. They have some of their Kona blends brewed and served as the standard coffee fare too, which is also seriously good. They've got a nice window at the front counter with some baked goods. There isn't much there right now, as I think they've only recently started serving food, but it sure would look good stocked with some interesting, local pastries and deserts.

The space is beautiful too. Chances are, after you pick up an espresso you're going to want to stay for a bit and soak up some of the killer atmosphere. Old wood, exposed brick, shiny chrome, the entire space is exquisitely designed and faultlessly put together. Fair warning though, the insides may be pretty to look at, but they sure aren't big. It's ok though. What Hula Girl lacks in space, it makes up in comfort. Sitting around Hula Girl and sipping an espresso just feels good. The space is nice, and there's a few wooden chairs and a little bar space where relaxing music, a comfortable vibe, and fantastic coffee is all in abundance.

Chances are, they'll be busy too. People around here seem to have already shifted their morning-coffee-loyalties over to Hula Girl, and that's a good thing, for Hula Girl and you. Somehow, in this small environment, more people just make it feel cozier, which you'll appreciate. And obviously it's good for Hula Girl because they get to succeed and stick-around, and honestly, there isn't much that's nicer to see succeed than an independent business run by nice people.

Good on the folks at Hula Girl for opening up on this tired part of Dundas with its old pizza joints and 2 dollar palm reading shops. This street really needed a place like this, and no doubt the people that live there will appreciate it too. Especially among all the artsy stuff that's crept up around here, pizza and palm-readings aside, Hula Girl seems perfectly at home.

Like I said, the coffee is spectacular. So if you want some near-perfect espresso made by people that truly know what that means, then Hula Girl should be on your to-do-list; but if you're looking for a place to grab a donut and suck up some free-WiFi, keep walking up the street to The Junction or down the street to Roncys.,2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

The main reason I tried this place is because of the location, only being about 5 minutes away from my house.  Christina did my nails, extremely helpful and nice.  She took her time to get me the the exact color I wanted, talked to me and offered me a drink.  I went in an hour before closing and the receptionist was afraid I wouldn't be able to squeeze in a pedicure, but Christina was fast and efficient to make sure I had enough time.  Another woman (I forgot her name :( ) did my pedicure when everyone was already packed up and ready to leave so I really appreciated that.  It seriously was the best pedicure I've ever had, all the tough skin I had on my feet gone.  A lot of people complain about the laziness of the owner, but I didn't see him fooling around.  A nail lady's phone was going off and he was attentive to put her ringer on silent, and sorting through the receipts with the receptionist. 

Only downside...the owner of the place was there today, and a bit standoffish.  I wouldn't say rude...but not friendly.  He interrupted my pedicure to have the lady check a yelp review (I'm assuming) because it was regarding a complaint and it was in a different language she could understand.  I didn't mind but it seemed unprofessional.  He kind of was staring at me, so I just said hello and he ignored me. :/ I would have given it five stars.  However, I work in an office, and a lot of ladies ask about my nails since I'm constantly working with my hands, and I will recommend this place and Christina!,1,Rr4nRgrl3JVJPdDSz4__PA
4970,ofFhVu7PcZZpP7VCqK12zg,0,2016-02-15,0,pHNPv6yShyRdURwY4rL2hA,1,CUSTOMER DISSERVICE.  I have been going to Golden Apple for years.  Usually I wait 10-15 minutes at each appointment, which is bad enough, but this time was the worst.  For this last appointment, I was asked to come in 10-15 minutes early to complete new paperwork due to management or ownership change, I wasn't clear on the reason.  Anyway, I arrived early as requested, completed my paperwork and was shown to the procedure room on time.  I should say that the receptionist was unsmiling and bordering on rude.  In addition, the person who showed me to the room was not knowledgeable and evasive with my two or three questions, telling me to ask the doctor on each of them.  Thirty minutes later, no one had come to inform me of a reason for the delay, or an estimate of how much longer the wait would be.  In fact, I thought I was forgotten.  So I went to the receptionist, who informed me that the doctor was with a new patient and should be finished any minute.  No apology, or even acknowledgment of my inconvenience; in fact, her attitude was almost to the effect of feeling bothered.  After returning to the room and waiting another 5-8 minutes, I left after being at my appointment for more than 50 minutes.  I had rearranged my work day and simply did not have time for the procedure, especially since I had no idea how much longer I'd have to wait.  In my opinion, Dr. Figueroa and the staff at Golden Apple do not respect their patients' time, or at least that of their existing patients.  New patients, beware.  I certainly hope Golden Apple does not have a policy to charge for missed appointments.  That would be a joke considering the disrespect they show their existing patients through the complete lack of regard for their time.  I highly advise trying one of the many other medical spas in the West Valley.,3,X72tQyDHRehGs6rwgt4EmQ

After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.

Ok. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.

The brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.

The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.

The thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.

People rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.

Make no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.

So would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.,7,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

3751,xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,0,2016-01-19,0,M4ql7C-LLXQLA9TvUexgUw,5,Tonight my husband and I visited Cleveland Tiffin and we were thoroughly satisfied with our experience.  Before I get into sharing about the food, I must express how friendly and personable Anup and everyone at Tiffin were.  While waiting for our food, Anup shared fascinating information about Tiffin Carriers in India.  I will continue to learn more about this process on my own.

     Now on to the dinner,  I am vegan so I ordered the Palak Paneer and traded out the paneer for tofu extra spicy.  I also ordered Vegetable Biryani extra spicy.   This was a delicious meal.  The spinach and tofu was so flavorful and fresh and the Biryani was aromatic and addictive.  My husband orders the Chicken Tika Masla.  He also enjoyed his dish as well.  The portions are large so I have a lot of food left over to eat.  All dishes are made to order...like a homemade meal.  With that in mind, prepare to order a couple of hours before you plan to eat dinner.  It is definitely worth the wait.,0,MONB2_AEZ8mkROhjEycJaA

Not only did we have to wait for an hour and a half in line to pick up the rental car, but the company added on a additional charges for fuel (even though I filled the tank full within a few miles of the rental car return) as well as late return fees.  

We had returned our vehicle on time according to the rental agreement, and when we did, their system was down.  We asked for a receipt or something showing the car was returned on time and they told us they couldn't provide anything.  When the final charge came in, they added on a late return charge and printed the receipt after their system was back up.  

I will never use this company again and I recommend you avoid them too.  The price is initially low when you reserve a car, but they add on false charges afterward.,14,mBpRrVzcUsLViA1r4Cua1Q

Our servers were very attentive without hovering, we got a bottle of wine, which they kept chilled at the bar for us. We got the lump crab & artichoke dip, which was delicious, and a very ample portion, so much so I opted for a salad and soup for dinner (pathetic I know while at a steak house, but the boyfriend let me try some of his steak). The wedge salad was pretty standard, good dressing, but had 2 pieces of almost whole bacon, not crumbled. The French onion soup was fabulous, cheese was nice and crispy on top, and a good amount of onions. The boyfriend got the Ribeye, perfectly cooked to medium, and nice grill marks and a juicy center. We will be back.,2,cwmozH0btTWP1a84TLoSJQ

From walking by, it doesn't look like the greatest place, but they have an interesting menu with different asian/asian fusion dishes so there's a little bit for everyone from the exotic to the simple.

The Malaysian Sate, which I had with beef, was delicious and came in a more than adequately sized portion. The Pad Thai is also a delicious meal. All of the appetizers and other dishes I tried were more than satisfactory. 

For a student on a budget, this place is both delicious and relatively inexpensive. I would recommend it to anyone who likes interesting tastes of Asia.,2,djSJ6a9gsLSdj-7BoyNNQA

I left with an oil change. 1 out of the 4 things I asked for was completed.  The reason I know nothing got done was it was not on my receipt for checking the fluids and I mark my tires to make sure they do a tire rotation.  I got home and my same mark was on my drivers side front tire.  Called them back and they said since my tires were worn that they can't rotate them...um b.s. They flat out did not do it.  This was after they would not prorate me for new tires that I bought from them and got 35,000 miles on 65,000 mile tires. They said I needed to have tire rotation records (which I do have just not from Brian's).  How do you get tire rotation records when you don't rotate the tires?  When I called Bridgestone about my tire warranty they said to not go there (Brian's) and go to another place   Shady place..be careful.,1,yD1NqQR3hfuq29hCLUVtvQ
2685,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,11,2013-02-16,1,sBcq7cMTRWzivpuVaGgIOA,5,Lucky Las Vegas!! Now you have 2 NOBU's gracing your city! Congrats to Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his business partner, Robert DeNiro (!!) on their beautiful newest creation..... NOBU at Caesar's Palace, LV!  

First, a few fun facts:
- The official ribbon-cutting was on February 2, 2013 
- Of the 29 NOBU restaurants, this is the largest location worldwide! 
- The NOBU Hotel, a boutique hotel which is next to the restaurant (both in Caeser's) is the first NOBU Hotel ever! It has 181 rooms, and even features a number of suites with up to 5 rooms. One of these days, I WILL stay here.... the pics of the rooms are gorgeous...and get this, 24-hour availability to Nobu in-room dining room service. Eeeep! ;)  

Now, back to the restaurant. You are greeted with an elegant entryway filled with origami birds overhead. Just past the check-in desk, you get a full glance of the beautiful modern & trendy main dining room filled with artistic lamps that look like floating jellyfish. There is a bar and lounge in the front area, sushi bar on the left side, and then the sea of seats filling the rest of the open & spacious layout. There are a variety of different style of seats to accommodate all different sizes of parties..... small tables for the romantic couples, larger booth tables (both circular and square), and secluded tables (in nest-like booth areas) for more private larger parties. There are also secluded areas for the teppanyaki grill tables. Overall, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, which sets the tone for the amazing food you are about to indulge in.

Now, onto the FOOD! Below are the dishes (mostly signature favorites) that me and the hubby had.... Each one was fabulous, and extremely satisfying....!!

1) Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - $28   (a MUST HAVE!)
six (heavenly!) thinly sliced pieces of yellowtail, with an even more thinly sliced piece of jalapeno on each. In a light ponzu sauce, and coupled with a piece of cilantro, this combo melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. This is my FAVORITE dish. I bet 99% of the people who get this are thinking should I order another round now or later? as they are finishing off this one ;) 

2) Black Cod w/ Miso - $34 (a MUST HAVE!)
So succulent & tender....every bite of it literally melts in your mouth! Don't pass on this one, thinking once you've had a good black cod, you've had em all. NOPE! This one is amazing & you should believe all the hype about it!! The sauce is light & sweet, and I just have a STRONG feeling you will not be disappointed :) 

3) Kumamoto Oysters with Nobu Sauce - $18 (a MUST HAVE!)
This comes with 3 oysters, each topped with a different garnishing (maui onion, las vegas, and jalapeno). If you have a party of 2, I strongly suggest you get 2 orders so that each person can have their own trio :) It was super fresh n delicious! 

4) Rock Shrimp Tempura - $24 (a MUST HAVE!)
OK, so per our server, this signature dish usually comes with either the Creamy Spicy or Butter Ponzu sauce.....but Exec Chef Thomas Buckley (who was brought over from the Miami Beach location) decided to throw in a 3rd sauce choice... Jalapeno! We couldn't decide between the butter ponzu & Jalapeno, so our server offered to bring it out not tossed, but with the 2 sauces 'on the side'. I suggest you do this, as both sauces were amazing and I think you can savor the flavors more with dipping rather than having it mixed in. Served on a bed of micro greens which also tasted good with the sauces. 

5) Spicy Miso Chips with Big Eye Tuna - $16
This was tasty but I felt that the plum sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Would have loved this if the sauce was more subtle... 

6) Pork Belly Miso Skewer - $14
If you love pork fat, this is your dish! Comes with 2 skewers of incredibly butter-like pork cubes. Tasty, but again I thought there was a lil too much sauce.  My hubby thought it was delicious though!

Dessert
We went with one of the most popular picks -- The Bento Box - $15
Flourless chocolate cake, with white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup, and house-made green tea ice cream. Delicious and the perfect way to wrap up a wonderful dinner experience. 

I'm already thinking about when I can go back again. Maybe Nobu will consider his next venue in the Bay Area? SF and San Jose would love one!!!!! :oD !!,20,1oCH03guW5bqwvLrCEuVwQ

+ The food is amazing.  They cook their tofu just right: crispy, tasty, fresh.  I'm also a huge fan of the Greenburger.  I would have to say it's even better than an In-and-Out burger (although now I'm a vegetarian).

- The food is good, but definitely not healthy.  Grease, with a side of fat.

-/+ Seating could be better.  I don't feel relaxed here.

+ One word: Soynamis.  These are frozen yogurt (soy, of course) treats with mix-ins, like fruit, nuts, etc.  Perfection in a cup.

-/+ Service.  They get your order in quickly and get the food to you fast.  However, I always find myself a little bummed out after ordering, they never smile!

4039,aQ5dTU00g8RPZnwHDMaDKw,0,2011-12-28,0,TI2PUzjvLpzRMS5NqzQbGw,5,My daughter began taking classes at Encore 6 years ago.  At the time she had a bit of an attitude and didn't do too well with other girls.  She instantly fell in love with Regina and took numerous classes from hip hop (her first choice) to ballet, jazz, and lyrical.  I watched my daughter blossom into an amazing young woman as well as an amazing dancer.  Regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem.  My daughter has had the opportunity to travel to California and Las Vegas with the studio to participate in Nationals and Master Classes.  Encore is not JUST family owned, it is a family environment.  I checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants.  I couldn't recommend anything more than Encore and the skills that your child learns.  My daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now.  I am looking forward to another 6 years or more with the Encore family.,7,CUAl6BGYGk28lA_W4PUH-A

However, I cannot recommend Target Optical for purchasing frames/glasses.  They have a limited selection and frankly, they are very expensive; even with insurance.  In addition, I found my lenses noticeably thicker, even though I ordered their high end lenses - i.e. I am not sure I received what I ordered. 

I can go to Costco Optical and get a superior pair of single-vision glasses (UV, Scratch Resistant, and Transition lenses) for less than half price I paid at Target Optical; plus the frame selection is better.

If I am going to continue spending the amount of money on Target classes, I might as well go to LensCrafters - they have a superior product and frame selection.,0,diP6dgit5poivnB3Y_ZuCw

We made reservations for a party of 4 on a Saturday night. Good thing too because the place was packed! I've actually tried to get in to this restaurant without reservations and been turned away because it's so busy. 

The restaurant itself is nicely appointed. We were seated in the back at a cute little booth, allowing us to look out at the whole of the restaurant. 

The service was friendly but a bit slow at times. It seemed that any time we wanted to order (drinks, entrees, and dessert), we had to wait for a fairly long time for our server to notice us. However cleaning up plates was very efficient. 

We also had problems with the restaurant running out of items we wanted. One person in the party ordered their ravioli and was told upon ordering that they were out of it. It really bothers me when restaurants don't tell you up front what they don't have in stock anymore. Otherwise you are happy with your choice and then need to make a split decision because the restaurant doesn't have it.  Two of us were also drinking Coke Zero and they ran out of that half way through the meal too. 

In terms of the food, I've been to this restaurant a few years ago and remember the food being better than this visit. I had the wild cheese tortellini and found it to be a bit bland. My husband had the bolognese which I also found to be a bit bland. The bruschetta was delicious and the tartufo was good as well so it was just the pasta sauces that could have used a bit more salt, or extra oomph. 

Comparing this restaurant to Michael's Back Door on Lakeshore, I'd prefer Michael's Back Door.,2,mfCYP8z56MdjaopG_zbbRw

Now, you'll see it in a sweet location in the Annex.

Full disclosure: I've been excited about this bakery opening for months, and I don't care who knows it. I have wanted a source for a steady supply of vegan magic squares, and now I have one (p.s. get the magic squares)

I had the opportunity to visit the bakery during the sneak-peak opening in December, and bought magic squares (but not enough), a cookie, and a couple of candied apples and it felt like early Xmas.

Then I waited (im)patiently for their opening this month. And today I braved the snow and went in. I left with dark chocolate croissants, magic squares (obviously), and a pot pie. My partner came home with croissants, a couple of sausage rolls and a whoopie pie. Yes, we're getting ready to hibernate this weekend.

The croissants are ridiculously flaky, the magic squares are incredible as usual, I haven't eaten anything else yet, but I've sort of come to expect that anything from APiecalypse Now! will be really good.

In the fridge & freezer so far they've got (all of these things are vegan): cashew ricotta, Caesar salad dressing, flavoured butters, lasagna, pot pies, shepherd pie, gluten free and gluten-full chili mac, potato salad, tzatziki, tartar sauce, Northwood Cold Brew Coffee (which I'm drinking right now - tasty), and more.

I like that there appears to be a sincere effort made to find ethical, ecologically sound, and human friendly products to make & bake stuff, and that they have compostable packaging.

Service was friendly and fast & they take cash, credit, and debit.

There is no seating inside, so prepare to take out.

P.S. try the magic squares.,6,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ

Here is how Ceasars Palace got two stars from me:
* STAR 1 - Saw it in almost 24 yo movie called Rainman
* STAR 2 - Saw it in Hangover

It would have gotten 3 more starts if:
* STAR 3 - Coffee and pastries in downstairs coffee shop were each $3 less and tasted better than hot bitter liquid and old newspapery food
* STAR 4 - They cut their prices in half and doubled the quality of their rooms
* STAR 5 - I had no other options

When I was a kid, this place was amazing...but even back then, I would have taken a Motel 6 and a happy meal toy over staying at Ceasars Palace.,0,XDZ8Igqxd_7Qk9YE7gvVfA

5 stars for the service- any and every server I have had has exceeded my expectations! wonderful people!
There is one bartender there, I cant remember his name, he is maybe in his 30's, definitely heavier set guy, mexican and i think he wears glasses; I don't enjoy being served by him, I've overheard some sexually inappropriate comments coming from him concerning other paying customers in the restaurant. I find this highly offense and unprofessional, it makes me extremely uncomfortable and I also wonder what comments he has made about my body sexually.
All of the hostesses there are nice, friendly and full of smiles, except one, I dont know her name either. She is mexican, and last time I was in there she was handing out food, which was new, considering she is the girl who never smiles and makes it seem like it's a painful task to seat me. She always glares at me, never smiles, sighs when I let her know how many people are in my party and lazily walks us to our table. However, every other hostess I have ever come across here is all smiles, courteous and just as friendly as the servers.

A couple bad apples can surely affect business, I know I avoid going to this establishment on certain days due to those specific employees. I have even mentioned something to the General Manager who simply replied, That is just who they are., with a smile on her face, like it wasn't a big deal and walked away. I was highly shocked, but with her attitude and lack of concern for the company, explains why those couple people act the way they do.,1,CwVG-QYRdufyMH_oPPH85w

Usually I've gotten it to-go but one time I dined in with a friend. It's a nice restaurant, clean, nice ambiance. There are several booths that would be equally good for families or for getting lunch with a friend.

I've had the poutine several times over the past two years or so and it's just right (in my opinion; your poutine preferences may vary). A good amount of fresh cheese curds, the fries aren't cut too thick or too thin, and the gravy's not too dark and heavy like at some other places I've eaten. The price is right -- I believe the small poutine (which for me is a generous enough serving) and can of pop I usually get is $9.

Finally, I've always gotten polite and friendly service when I've eaten here. I've taken friends here before and I would do it again if I want to get poutine with them close to home.,0,W0EuBNjhbXaA7AJrAW_vvQ

I don't know what it looks like during the regular days, but considering there were kids that didn't want to leave the park today, there must be lots of them. Happy to skip that. 

We booked adult night tickets in advance online, so it was a bit cheaper than getting them at the door, and while it still felt a bit expensive, I did spend around 2 hours running around the park and having fun on rides (there are two of them), playing games, and building cars (and then racing them) with LEGO, and building minihouses with duplo, so overall I had a good time. I also liked the miniatures exhibit of Toronto's downtown and area.

All of the staff was all friendly as well.

The thing is - Legoland is small, and there isn't *that* much to do. We finished with everything quite quickly, and found ourselves wondering what else is there...

It's in Vaughn Mills (a mall), at entrance 4.

I took the Basic Sewing Essentials class on a whim, and now I can't wait to take more. The classes are small (just 6 people) and easy to follow. The instructor was helpful, with good advice on troubleshooting machine problems, threading issues, and other sewing machine stuff. I left feeling like I had learned something that I could actually do again without  being confused. Karyn, the owner, was our instructor and came around regularly to check on everyone and offer help or advice.

There is a store dog, and initially, that was weird, but in a good way. I usually don't like dogs, but this one is laid back, friendly (but not too friendly) and spent most of her time on the couch in the back. 

The fabric selection is awesome. So many different colours and textures. They have fat quarters in various styles and colours, notions, patterns, and other supplies.

Really positive experience, and I would recommend it if you're looking for fabric, or if you're looking to start taking sewing classes.,5,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ

Their selection ranges from the weird and absurd to vintage and kitschy to antique, retro, funky cool.  Unfortunately, as of late, their selection has not turned over very quickly, is dull and uninspired and priced all over the map.  There were times when I could not leave without that breathless feeling of finding the perfect treasure you had no idea you needed until you saw it, the maze of aisles confusing me with treasures galore, all over the store and me not being to remember them all.  Not so at present.  I am hopeful that the Spring yard sales and Estate sales will breathe some life back into the long, winding aisles of the Sleepy.

I have come here for years.  I had a booth at their old location and at this location-- I love the hunt, the repurposing of goods, the uniqueness that only this type of place can bring into your home... I hope this is just a little bump in the road for us.  I was there-- in and out-- in under an hour this past Sunday (unheard of!).  And left without anything... not only did I leave with nothing, I left not seeing anything that I would buy if only I could...

I'll say upfront that I know little to nothing about cars or their upkeep. I took my 19 year old Caravan in because there was a major leak from under the hood. Not only was Damien courteous but he didn't make me feel like an idiot for not knowing more about my vehicle. I have literally been scoffed at, looked down upon and taken advantage of by other service centers but not here. Pep Boys was honest in their assessment and totally understood why I would not have the costly repair done. I have FINALLY found my auto repair guys (for at least as long as Damien stays there) and would highly recommend this shop to anyone who, like me, knows nothing about cars and is tired of feeling that they are being taken advantage of and looked down on. AND to top it off they're charge for a quote was beyond reasonable. They could have dinged me to death with fixing one thing and then saying that they found another, and another, and another like I have experienced over the years from other auto repair places. What a relief to know that the next time I have a car that needs something done, I do not have to go through that nervousness and fear, I just have to got to Pep Boys on E.

Cons: Asian Sesame Chicken Salad

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? Maybe

On Wednesday around 12pm, I went to the restaurant to get my food to go and have my lunch on another place. The place was crowded, but I noticed some free seats there. The cashier line was not so big and I did not take so much time to place my order.

After paid, I direct myself to the food delivery station and noticed something that I never noticed on the other restaurants on the USA side. They have a monitor that counts how much time each food is taking to be ready to go and the order changes color when it takes so much time. Nice thing. It incentives the staff to have always a better performance.

Overall, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious like always, but I did not like so much the salad. Different than on USA, I found big chunks of lettuces instead of in small pieces like the other restaurants. This is a negative point to me, because I expect always a good preparation for this food due to the complexity of it. But I am willing to give a new chance to the place.,0,95KCaXFJEGla4AK7ETBmWw

I ordered the soup, which was a hearty miso based vegetable lentil, with lots of greens and packed with flavour. Perfect for today's rainy glumness.

The space is really clean and relaxing, there is seating for about 4 people, but like I said, it's styled as a take-out place (so you know, you could hypothetically take stuff out, and eat in the park.) There are fresh herbs in a wall-mounted garden (that look absolutely lovely). They also have a useful website that actually gives you the information 

I've come to expect raw cakes to be delicious, and Feel Good Guru's cake was no exception. In fact... it was even better than I expected it to be (and the raw bar is raised pretty high already.)

I just wish they had sport peppers.  Oh well, you can't win them all.  

Their cajun fries are also a must!  I'm not a big french fry fan (especially the thick cut kind), but the fries here are to die for!  The cajun fries are extra addicting (which is probably why they have such generous portions).

It was my first trip to Las Vegas and my boyfriend wanted to impress. By taking me here, he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himself.

We were recommended to try the Chef's menu and also followed it with the wine pairings. We both enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartar, LOVED the lobster pot pie, which got the pie to innards content right (I like a little breadness with each bite), and both of us were in awe of the Kobe with sear foie on top. I don't know if they still do that, but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit. It's in our top 2 of steaks...and trust me, we eat a lot of steak. I don't even remember the dessert, that's how mind blowing the steak was. I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.

Service was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread. The wine pairings were done well, but I was happy I was staying in the Bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension or over-styling. Probably the most comfortable restaurant I went to in Vegas. Most people were well dressed (i.e. slacks and dresses) but no need for anything over the top. I wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks. While we were probably the youngest ones there, the servers didn't treat us like we didn't belong there, which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants. Big plus for that.

I'd love to go back, but this time, I'd probably order something different just so I could try other things...but I'd get the Kobe again. For sure.

It's worth the pennies to go, and try the chef's menu!,0,1cd1TjQEynOjhBT-3Qnsjg

With the child admission you get a small pumpkin to decorate and a bag of stickers for decorating it. As well as access to a bouncy house, corn maze, and viewing animals. My 2 year old son loved running around and walking along with chickens/turkeys. He enjoyed climbing the massive dirt pile and investigating all of the pumpkins. He was in and out of the bounce house and had a fun time seeing the animals. We didn't spend our time decorating our pumpkin there because there was a lot of fun wandering around to do! It was a nice two hour morning outing to get him tired and hungry for lunch and a nap! We will be sure to return!,5,Vzm4fJnIxmgSKTgR1-0uzA

While quite pricey, and can be replicated at home at a fraction of the cost, its a nice place to spend a few hours with friends catching up, or studying. 

You are pretty safe ordering most of the items on the menus, except for the mushroom soup. I was under the impression that it was a cream of mushroom soup, but it was far from what I had expected. It was more sour and strange, so I couldn't finish it. Before I ordered, I did ask to confirm that it was cream of mushroom soup, but upon tasting, I think that it had more of a wine base than cream base. Maybe my taste buds are not refined enough, and the soup is actually good? I'm not sure.,0,hJulW1s6tOBr2NXD9nAoMQ

177,5PO5ZIHIcaTNIiHNoRKDqg,0,2012-06-21,1,r13Q1UVbPED1I-RRsbJDgw,1,The Kensington Cornerstone offers a gluten free menu.  It has gluten free beer.  It has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  I chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  It checked a lot of boxes on my list.  I won't be going back.

This past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.

It was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. 

Just when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and/or mojitos, and/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer, so I was looking forward to trying a new one.  I asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.

When our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.

So by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. 

(Sound of clock ticking)

Another half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy, but you should still be able to pick it up. 

My mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.

Looking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. 

After we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been.,1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

My boyfriend is nicer than I am. Seriously, I doubt my cat would've eaten it. What really got me however was the fact that when we politely informed the staff we were questioned 3 times about why it wasn't good. Now, I could have been straight up honest and flat out rude about it but it not our style. The man who questioned us could have been a manager but since he never identified himself he could have been anyone. I suggest the zipps staff eat it themselves and find out exactly why it's worthy of sending back.

Saving money was not worth it.  First, the delivery guys come in said the refrigerator will not fit.  Well i did the measurements and it would.  They spoke spanish to each other.  All of the sudden the refrigerator was damaged and the did not let me see it. Delivered another on Sunday.    Second, they got the stove in,  they supposively shut off the gas as my valve is in the basement.  They claimed it could not move the stove all the way back, that i need a gas company to move the line.  This was all done on Friday.   Monday, I go in my kitchen i smelled gas.  Called the gas company to find out HHGREGG did not use the shutoff valve but loosed a bolt.  I watched them, what did i know.   Then i got Mertz to come to move gas line.  $135 later to find out they can move the stove back.   Thirdly, they put my dishwasher in crookedly.  They had to come back.  They unscrewed one side and shoved it in.  Then the disposal kept backing up in my dishwasher. I called they said that was normal.  I said no it is not.  The same guy came, moved one piece said should be good.  Heck no, called again, they made service call again.  The,people never called for time range, i called they said it is scheduled and no time. That i cannot call until after 530 if they do not show. Then called nothing, called the next day. Finally they got someone there.  He said it was hooked up wrong a suppoively fixed it.  Guess what it was not fixed and seriously another repeat, no call for time just got off after an 1.5 hour time, mostly hold and transfers.  No time again.  They to call me and suppoively sending me 100 dollars, better not be a gift card.  Bc they cannot pay me a milloin dollars,to EVER shop at another HHGREGG again!,0,6kU66quEIS06wLZC7tLoHw

I opted for a regular sized poutine of the vegetarian variety, with tomatoes, roasted red pepper, goat cheese, sour cream and of course gravy. It was a little soupier than I had anticipated, but I can only blame myself for choosing so many sauces/cheeses. I just couldn't pass any of those up nor do I regret my decision. My boyfriend got a large poutine, which was basically enough to feed a family of four. And he topped his with gravy, sauteed onions, mushrooms and chicken. We were unable to finish his so we packed it up and enjoyed the rest later that night. And it was delicious! I should also note that the service at this location was impeccable, my boyfriend forgot to check off which gravy he wanted, he left that box blank, so when they brought us our dishes they also brought a soup bowl full of gravy for him, just in case, without us even asking. I just thought that was really intuitive and great customer service! All in all, I will definitely go back to this location next time I'm in Montreal.,1,QoDP81Xnvcl_EQ_Lut2AXA

Hostess told us only a 20 minute wait, ended up taking 45 min, I love Korean BBQ so it was worth the wait. The crappy part of waiting was watching parties the same size or with 1 more than our party get seated first. I decided to ask and they said that a table of 5 had to be seated first because the table of 5 was ready (we he 4 in our party) not sure how that worked. Once we were seated we were greeted right away and I was ready to order. I asked for the premium steak, 2 orders of brisket and the marinated steak. They ended up bringing everything except for the second brisket. You are allowed to order 4 meats, every time we asked for more than 1 of a meat they wouldn't bring it. Service was really good at first, It went to a crap after the first 30 min (it's a 2 hour minimum) which is fine but me and the wife didn't leave full at all. Our waiter seemed to try and not make eye contact every time he walked by, we would have to ask the busser or anyone else that walked by for our next meat. Once we were ready to go, I looked over he check and they charged my 4 year old and 2 year old 10$ each for all you can eat. They both only had rice.... Not sure how that works.

Cons: None this time

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? Maybe

On Wednesday around 7:30pm, I went to the restaurant to get my food to go and have my dinner on another place. The cashier was very quick and nice to take my order and at this time there were no line to place my order there.

After paid, there is a place that you can sit to wait for your food to be ready. I waited more or less 15/20 minutes for everything to be done. While I was waiting, I was using the free Wi-Fi to check my e-mails and read the news.

Overall, the fries were dry but tasteful. They were not greased or unseasoned and the burger at a first sight seemed dry what is a bad sign most of the times.

So, I am starving I just got home from working on the strip and I work at Bar too that closes at one in the morning that is why I called to ask. My husband and I walk inside and sit right in front of the bar at one of the high tops it was 15 mins before anyone came to greet us or give us any menus. Finally, a male bartender came and greeted us he was friendly but was in a rush to get our order he just handed us the menu and asked Do you know what you want? We needed a min and did not ask if we wanted some thing to drink or nothing just I assumed you been here before. Retarded how can you say that to a guest. So, he came around sooner than I thought to take our order the way it was going we asked for it to go. I ordered the chicken dinner with rice and veggies; my man got a bucket of buffalo wings with extra buffalo on the side and an order of fried cheese. Then he asks do you want a drink while you wait we both said no it is okay.( In my head you'd probably bring it when the food is ready anyway.)  So it took 30 to 45 mins for the bar food to come out; we had paid before hand too and had to go up to the bar to ask the bartender how much longer that's when he finally got the food. I guess he noticed we gave him 20% and was extremely fast and nice I walked out My husband stayed to get some ranch to go. When we get home his wings were PLAIN we hand to melt butter and mix it with franks to toss the wings in to make them buffalo. Other than that the food was good the veggies did not seem fresh if anything they are frozen or canned.

Although I did my best to educate myself and hire the highest-rated company nearby, it's almost impossible to know whether your ducts need cleaning, or whether the job was done correctly. For these reasons, I had reservations. As it turns out, the house we bought had new ductwork installed just two years ago and there was only minimal dust in the air ducts. The very professional crew came out and did their job. They were honest to offer their expert opinion. I then called Steve who listened intently to what I had to say. Long story short, he did what was the right thing to do, out of decency and good business ethics. He renewed my faith in honest business and unparalleled customer service. 
I plan on using their services every time. I highly recommend this company. Don't even look elsewhere.,0,Uy3nWPNRJsT5xLX1IHWzoQ

Every vape shop has a tasting counter, but they are all about processing customers - try, buy, next.  Jan's definitely selling mods, coils, and juice, but EBV has perfected the chill lounge model.  It's like Cheers for Vapers, building a community of practice and appreciation for tobacco counterculture to such an extent that the 'store' concept feels decidedly anticapitalist. 

Which is why, perhaps, the Eastern Bloc brand is so apt.  At EBV you're not working with a disillusioned teenaged vaper getting paid minimum wage - you're working with a guru.  A vapor sommelier.  Somebody who is genuinely invested in your interest in vaping.  If you are looking for mod build tips, ideas, an incredible tasting bar with some of the best juices on the market (not just proprietary homebrew BS), or, most importantly, a place to just hang and vape with some great company you've never met before, Eastern Bloc is a must.  Go now.  Sit, vape, and be merry.,4,fsUMORfhG2rwE7rX8uYmmQ

The Lakeview is open 24 hours-a-day, and that definitely contributes to one of the cool aspects of this place: it isn't that you can eat imaginative diner-esque food at 3 o'clock in the morning on a Tuesday, but also thatyou can eat it at 3 o'clock in the afternoon on aSunday and the experience is entirely different.
That's because it's inconsistent, but not in a bad way. It's inconsistent because of the diverse group of peeps you can expect to see there when you go: Sunday afternoon is the brunch crowd, Saturday evening is the daters, Friday late-night is the Ossignton bar crowd. Whenever you go, it's a different sorta experience.
It's not just diversity that makes this a kick-ass experience, the food is also spectacular and truly imaginative. The style of upscale-diner definitely comes through on their menu withitems like theCorriander Walnut Pesto Omelette, a Peameal Brie and Havarti Cristo-style sandwich, and the Lakeface Albacore Tuna Melt. It's a genuinely nice blend of the expected and the unexpected. As a side note, I need to mention the impressive veggie burger they've got that's made from black beans and served with a wild mushroom saute and caramelized onions. Spectacular. Whether it's their 24-hour menu or their brunch menu, vegetarian or carnivore items, this place cranks out some delicious food.
I'd definitely recommend you check out The Lakeview. They're doing diner food right, 24 hours-a-day.,2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

It's very homey- the table tops are made out of wood grain and the atmosphere is very relaxed. The cashier is all smiles.  You think there are only three tables but you look to your left and there's a whole other seating space to take advantage of. I came here right before the said happy hour and got a medium cappuccino sprinkled with hot chocolate powder for $3.75 (with tax). I saw that they also offered breakfast items that are similar to Bluestone Lane in NYC, like the avocado smash bagels and avocado eggs Benedict.  The drinks are all under $4, but the price of the menu items seem to make up for the difference. A fruit cup will set you back $5. However, my friend ordered a bagel and it was served on a nice platter. Good service and good environment. Bring a friend and have a coffee chat! It's quiet in the afternoon.,0,0Q5EIFIxISWttluPPHh2ag

They were hesitant to stitch up my daughter as the laceration was on her face, and they wanted a pediatric plastic surgeon to do it, but, as she had already had stitches in the EXACT same spot twice-- one of those times being at a clinic in a county that did not have a plastic surgeon, I assured them that plastic surgery to repair the scar was probably in her future, and asked them to sew her up .

The burrito consisted of a mostly (90% no joke) mix of bland rice/beans with one strip of fish buried in the fold of the burrito.
Seriously, I had to OPEN it to make sure I hadn't received the wrong order. My dining partner had 3 pork taco's, which were better... But nothing special.

However, I haven't been going to this one lately because of how bad it was the last few times I went. I got chicken nuggets that tasted horrible. How can you ruin chicken nuggets? I got a salad that was significantly smaller than usual and contained wilted lettuce. I don't even think it was the same type of lettuce usually used in that salad. Worst of all, the service wasn't good in the drive-thru, and good service is usually a cornerstone of any Chick-fil-a. The last time I went through the drive-thru was on a weekend. It appeared that only teenagers were working and there were many of them. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but it took forever to get through the drive-thru. I've seen them get two long lines of cars through in no time, but not this time. While I was waiting in the line of cars, I suddenly heard yelling. Apparently two young employees were arguing by the open door between the ordering speaker and the window. I got to listen to that go unchecked for awhile in the slow moving line. When we finally got to the window, there were probably 10 teenagers standing around chatting about their love lives and various other things, but nobody was standing at the window to take my money or give me my order. There was one young lady who was trying to get everyone to work, but she was being ignored. Finally, the one person doing any work got our order together and took my money and gave me my food. After all that, they forgot my honey mustard sauce! My suggestion would be to have a responsible adult member of management work on the weekends, because the kiddos aren't managing themselves.,0,jBh_F1Sb7nkoEz_nyyiaxw

She chose this as our destination.  Really, I was ready to open my wallet and just be done.  Too bad the sales staff was unhelpful and a little... rude.  I asked them, very pointedly, for help.  I knew my daughter would trust their opinion more than mine (and they were both wearing those mullet shirts --you know long in the back, short in the front-- and, well, that is just not a style I am able to work with, so I did not just want their help, I *needed* their help).  They nonchalantly pointed to a section of clothes that she might like.  I inquired about help with sizing, to which, again, I was met with no offer of help.  She tried on a few things but she was frustrated with sizing and I was annoyed, so we left, empty handed.

To be sure, this is not my style of clothing, but I know there are some school friends that have picked up some cute clothes in here.  With all the options available in Charlotte, and when I am paying full-retail pricing (to be fair-- their retail pricing is affordable/reasonable, hence 3 stars), I expect better and more helpful service.  

I opened my wallet somewhere else... where I got to sit and watch the salesgirls work their magic and help my daughter feel a little special.,5,OQT9DjfBrzrwOEdVJjuYIA

So lovely. I can't wait to keep going back.

As an added bonus, since they only recently took over that location they are part of the Indie Coffee Passport less-than-3 Edition, so you can give them a try, while taking advantage of a really great deal.

My husband and I were excited to go, especially because it also boasted a beautiful rooftop dining patio.  The experience was neat, as the entrance is an unmarked door in an alley and after being checked off the reservations list were escorted up an old industrial elevator to the top floor.  We had the place to ourselves which was a little weird at 6:30 on a Saturday night.  This meant our waitress was very attentive.  The wine list was short and expensive but did have a bottle of Canadian red which was delicious.  The food was very expensive as well and was fine, but not delicious and worth the cost ($50/main mean plus $7/side vegetables).  The salmon appetizer was very disappointing since it was just a couple slabs of cold salmon and no flavor profile.

Reason #1 - It's got the word pho in the name, so you know it's good.

Reason #2 - They are from Saigon, where pho was invented, so you know they know what they are doing here.

Reason #3 - The number 8 is a very humbling number to give ones self. It's better then 5 and not as douchey as 10.  So you know they've got class.

Yup, the humblest, most authenticest, phoiest restaurant on Eastern. Much better than Pho Saigon 7 and less pretentious then Pho Saigon 9.

4595,xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w,0,2010-01-31,1,pdD3ObAgR4NIdFd4cxByyw,3,I suppose that I have some explainin' to do, considering that my group of 3 friends and I dropped $500 on dinner here yet only gave it 3 stars. 

So, let me start with the sides. We tried the Hen of the Woods mushrooms, gold yukon potato puree and asparagus. The hen of the woods mushrooms were quite good, but nothing I can't put together myself. They had no great sauce, no POW factor. The gold yukon potatoes were fine - nice potatoes that were boiled and pureed to baby-food texture. No special or unique flavors going on there. Finally, I'm convinced the asparagus was just microwaved in some water. Very poor effort there, guys. Considering each of these dishes was $15-$25, I'm very disappointed. 

Now, onto some better things. I had the lobster bisque which was very good. Nice and creamy with succulent chunks of lobster. The only complaint I have, if it even counts, is that they served me a ton. It was very rich and I didn't have a cup of bisque, it was a giant bowl. 

On to the most important thing, which were the steaks. My friends ordered the 16oz Ribeye, 16oz New York Strip, 12oz Hanger and I had the grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak. They were all really, really good but I have mixed feelings here. Sure, they were cooked perfectly, but I can do that at home on my grill. No sauces here, nothing; just pure steak goodness. It was my first time ordering the wagyu beef, and it was good, but I actually preferred the Hanger of the four steaks we ordered. 

Overview: The service was impeccable. The wine list was extensive (however out of our price range, at $125 per person without drinks). Though the steaks and bisque were great, the sides were eerily reminiscent of my grandmothers (terrible) cooking. I think Craftsteak is a poor value for your buck, therefore I'll give it 3/5 - A-OK.,0,mFBIF-EQ8OdLw15rzFf1sw

I took my four year old daughter here one afternoon after she insisted for hours that she wanted a haircut.  She went in with a hairstyle I would lovingly call 'bird's nest' and came out with an adorable and well done bob. She did not mind the no-frills atmosphere. There was a local anchorman and an elderly gentleman getting their hair did, too.  Old-school barber with friendly service at a great price... ($15 without tip) and a dumdum lollipop? Good stuff.

It tastes ok...not terrible but no seasoning to it. I like the A.&W.'s onion rings the best. Crispy and firm at most A&W's. Peter's were simple and bland. Maybe a bit like back in the 50's?  The burger was ok; it looked to be put together as an after thought and squished. The good thing is the variety milkshake flavours. That was what I was into; but for me; the milkshakes didn't have enough of that dairy/ice cream flavour for me. It was good but not giving me a wow factor. It didn't taste like real ice cream shake to me. I won't rave about it but don't hate it there. It's not a place I would want to go as top thing to do when in the area.

Portions here are pretty big so come hungry.  The carnitas and roasted chicken are juicy and come with great sides.  Good salsa and guacamole as well.

The service was horrible we constantly had to ask the bus person to find us the waiter. Way Way overpriced and an added 18% service charge for poor service.

Charcuterie Platter ($16 small/$25 large) & Thuet Bread ($2 small/$4 large
)This is a wonderful introduction for those who have never tried charcuterie. Basically, charcuterie is a series of meaty products (cured, whipped & other preparation techniques) served on a wooden platter.
All offered with a pile of full-seeded mustard, a dish of teeny-tiny pickled vegetables, and we ordered Thuet Bread on the side. The Thuet bread was soft & fresh - a great accompaniment.
The star was the foie gras mousse - whipped to perfection, it just melts in your mouth.

Roasted Bone Marrow ($9)
Hollowed with a little spoon & sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt on top of warm, smoky bread, this was tasty and good for the immune system. I reminded myself of the health benefits as I savoured each bit of fatty, rich, comforting flavour.

Tongue in Brioche ($13)
The sandwich was a ridiculously generous portion of thinly sliced beef tongue between two plump slices of fragrant brioche, all held together with a skewered cornichons. A healthy (hah!) dose of mustard and tarragon mayo drizzled all over made my heart skip - whether it was in fear or excitement, I'm still not sure.
Incredibly soft and tender, prior to this delight I didn't know that tongue could be this delectable. While I prefer the buttery & decadent Tongue Grilled Cheese at Hoof Cafe, I would never turn down this sandwich.

Raw Horse Sammy w/ Hot Sauce ($22)
Fresh bread topped with horse tartar with a raw egg yolk & shallots on one slice, and a liberal helping of hot sauce on the other. The HORSE spelled out in sauce was a fun touch. I couldn't believe how tasty the raw horse meat was - I tried it with and without the hot sauce & bread to get a sense of the true flavour.

Crispy Pig Ear Salad
Strips of breaded & deep-fried pig ears over radishes, carrots, edible flowers with a lime buttermilk dressing
I liked the pig ears, but I found the dressing too buttery and generous on the salad. As someone who prefers light, acidic dressing (or none at all with the right greens!) it was unappetizing. However, I was at the Black Hoof so this was to be expected.
The pig ears were crispy as advertised, and full of fatty-flavour with each bite. A dining companion claims that Buca does a better version...

Fluke Crudo
Fluke along with charred fava beans, avocado cream, sliced chili, pancetta, herbs & cilantro dressing.
I really liked the avocado cream and fava beans. A little heavy on the dressing (but again, it's Hoof!) but the combination of the sliced chili & cilantro was delightful with the fish. Love the plating :)

N'Duja & Corn Tagliatelle
House tagliatelle noodles with charred corn, charred cherry tomatoes, and the n'duja which is a spicy calabrese salami melted into the pan. Garnished with a green onion salad on top.
Mmm. I realy enjoyed this - house pasta was al dente and the creamy sauce blended very well with the charred corn and tomatoes. I still have trouble pronouncing it, but the n'duja was quite tasty with a bit of heat and I would happily order this dish again. Creamy, spicy, & corny goodness. I love sweet corn!

Pork Belly, Squid,& Melon
Baby squid, Berkshire pork belly & chunks of melon in a watermelon glaze with turmeric, cumin. Flaxseed, Vietnamese cilantro, mint, & basil also riddle this succulent dish.
While the pork belly and the squid were both well done and delicious, the pairing did not do much for each other. They were enjoyed separately with the watermelon glaze. I must have gotten a good chunk of watermelon, as a dining partner-in-crime said she didn't taste the melon but I certainly did. As usual, the pork belly made me pause to fully enjoy the flavour. So decadent and perfectly pan-cooked.

Calf's Brain Ravioli
House ravioli in sage, brown sugar, & butter sauce with Parmesan shavings
So...It was an oily mess, and I was very glum as a result. From the poor presentation, meagre calf brain filling, blah pasta, and too-sharp cheese I reluctantly ate all 5 raviolis wondering why I was even bothering with each bite. It was cooked al dente, just like the tasty tagliatelle, but I don't think that that is the best way to cook ravioli. Sigh. A fellow diner sampled a bit of my dish and agreed that it was simply not good. Darn it. But that's 1 bad dish out of so many amazing ones...so all is forgiven =)

We were just wandering on our way to the train station and came across it. Even if you aren't a vegetarian or vegan, it's still delicious. They have soups and a salad bar, so it's perfect for a light lunch. I had a tomato soup and salad and it was delicious. They also had cooked food- like vegetarian shepherd's pie, spaghetti squash pasta, roasted veggies, along with desserts, juices and coffees. The setting was lovely, the staff were nice and it was very clean. There were also big windows, so it would probably be perfect for a sunny mid-day coffee and snack or slow, light lunch.,0,YVBzFKNTOysdAfJtQhQD2g

2792,iXUxp09odGN2qhdPU6TKYQ,0,2012-04-02,1,LDZZr7kEGOdxWk8M19FRUA,1,Financing department and service department are the two most dishonest and disappointing departments ever.  Here's the story...........  I bought a 2009 Maxima from them in December.  I got what I wanted, traded my truck that was falling apart for a newer, nicer used car from Horne Kia.  I went in there with a loan from my bank already approved so I didn't need their financing.  I went in there with the loan approval number and was happy when they told me everything was good and they would get the information about my new car to the bank so they could complete the loan.  They didn't.  They opened a new loan with my bank so that they could make some money off the new loan that they started.  Now, this normally wouldn't be that big of a deal, aside from it causing my credit to be run again, but they lied about it to me, which is unacceptable.

So, with the purchase of my new, used car, I get a free oil change when it's due.  This brings me to this last Saturday, when I brought it in for it's first oil change.  I made an appointment for 9:30AM on Saturday to do a basic oil change.  My wife and I drop it off and they tell us it will take and hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes.  No problem since they seemed rather busy, we'll go get some breakfast.  So it's after 12:30 and still no call, I figure they may have forgotten to call us and we just head back there since it's been three hours.  Much our dismay, we get there and it's still in the same spot it was in when we left.  I go into the office, which is now virtually empty, and speak with the service advisor I dealt with earlier.  He tells me that they had to go get an oil filter from a parts store since it was a Nissan they were working on and they were a Kia dealership.  Well, that makes sense if I hadn't made an appointment 8 days earlier and they weren't expecting me.  But here's the real kicker; a 2009 Maxima takes the exact same oil filter as virtually every Kia from 2008 and before, as well as some 2010 Kia's.

Apparently this service advisor thought I wouldn't know this, as most people wouldn't, I'm sure.  When I asked him again what part it was they had to go get from a parts store, giving him the chance to be honest with me, he lied again.  Therefore, I presented him with this information and he instantly turned quite sheepish, not knowing what to say.  I proceeded to tell him that all we wanted was some honesty and they obviously don't deliver that at this dealership.  My wife and I walked away and he had nothing to say.

Case and point: NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE.,4,f59f2MbYILQznPvc9iBDog

The service is great, the cocktails are delicious, and the food - whoa.  The bream ceviche was mindblasting, and the octopus was out of this world awesome.  Really, really, really good.  I only went the one time so I'm not telling you you need to get those things, but you certainly won't be disappointed if you do.

Ambiance was okay - a predilection to play music a tad too loud like many restos catering to the young professional sensibility, which I don't get, but it seems the trendy thing to do.  Attracts annoying overpaid hipster patrons as well - the table next to us was a clamorous sea of forgettable vapid single women in their 30s that would repeatedly rupture into a crescendo of squeals: this song is about me! or I know the chef, ladies I know the chef - WHY ISN'T ANYBODY LISTENING TO ME? or Tamara is a super betch or new girl sits down at table, prompting sounds that could etch glass, despite it being said Tamara.  Etcetera.  If it wasn't for our neighbours, the entire experience would have been ethereally sublime.

We had the table closest to the door, it was winter, and it was crazy cold sitting there.  Don't sit there.  Still, despite being a complainer and loving all things complainy: 5 stars, hands down one of the more memorable culinary experiences I've had in the city.

Unfortunately, I'm not really sure what kind of style she gave me. It ended up looking very choppy in the back - two very drastic layers with no texturing - and then an A-line cut which looked a little goofy since I have shoulder length hair.
I ended up going to Cassie at Salon G (just down the road) and she fixed my cut and I love it now.,0,2tOHlIE3sTntIX5DiE3l4w

Perhaps it's because I'm from Boston, so I'm spoiled when it comes to fresh seafood, but I found it difficult to find any appetizing seafood here.
I started with the crab legs, which weren't bad, but were a bit stringy. I moved onto the cajan shrimp and calamari.. The shrimp wasn't edible, beyond fishy(YUCK!), the calamari was passable. Finally I made it to the lobster tails... ummm... I've had lobster countless times, I wouldn't call these lobster tails. They had a greyish tint, tasted like rubber, and left a very unsettling feeling in my stomach. 
Again, perhaps I'm spoiled by the fresh seafood of the east coast, or perhaps I was perturbed to have paid for a buffet of buffet pass, and paid an additional $15 for this seafood travesty, but I will not be back.,5,cwmozH0btTWP1a84TLoSJQ

The starters were shrimp wrapped in a taquito-like shell, and a mango salad.  I enjoyed the shrimp, but I found the mango salad was too sweet to be a good appetizer.  For the mains my companion and I ordered a tofu curry and chicken in a cashew sauce with noodles, respectively.  

Nothing unusually striking with my chicken dish.  The flavor was quite acceptable and portion size was good.  My companion didn't have any complaints about the curry dish, and she even brought home the leftovers.  Dessert consisted of two pieces of fried banana and a scoop of coconut ice cream.  Both were quite appealing, though I accidentally got some of the fried banana syrup on my finger.  The syrup was incredibly sticky and I had to wash it off at a sink as merely using a napkin was not enough.

The dining area is small (under 10 tables), and the service was excellent.  I did not see a picture of the Thai king on the wall, which to my understanding every Thai restuarant ought to have.

Let's start with the drinks - they have an excellent beer selection, including fat tire which is one of my favorites.  Pitcher for $22 = very happy me.

Their burgers were cooked to perfection and included fresh, very tasty ingrediants that matched some of the other upscale burger places I've been - like Five Napkin in Manhatten.  I had the Black Jack Burger, which I can attest was fantastic.  My friends also enjoyed the American Classic, Black Angus Beef and Original Ultimate Burgers.

As far as sides, I tried their sweet potato fries as others on Yelp have said they are fantastic - I thought they were good but nothing special.  If I were to go back and I would probably go with regular fries.

Finally, the atmosphere was great.  Very modern place and it was packed, everyone was having a great time.  Great experience, I would definitely recommend.,1,mFBIF-EQ8OdLw15rzFf1sw

not for the Indie Coffee Passport.

First thing Saturday morning, I went over there to meet up with Nicole H. for a minicoffee crawl.

I got there way too early, but the moment I walked in, I instantly felt comfortable and welcome. It's the kind of place I could see myself visiting everyday for a coffee. Very friendly atmosphere, the lighting was great, and there was ample seating (but of course,  it was 10am on a Saturday morning). It was obvious this was a local spot, people coming in and out, chatting with Bob (the owner) like he was an old friend. 

I ordered my usual large soy latte. It was so good. Thick, with a cute three dimensional heart made of crema. And I just loved the cup. I commented on it in my head and then again to Nicole H when she got there. It was the perfect size and shape to hold with both of my hands. Also, I was very happy to see they don't charge extra for soy milk!

Other things that are great: 
- They have free wifi (when I went in, the password was on the chalkboard at the front)  
- There is definitely an outlet at the back corner. I didn't look anywhere else, but there is at least one!
- There are vegan snacks, soups, sandwiches in addition to several nonvegan options.

132,uF86ZhygpBEGr3CudNemYA,1,2011-03-17,3,YCilP6BtVj-3Pjq3uTXVwA,1,For those that don't know, O.Noir is that unique place where you dine entirely in the dark. Yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust. You can't see a dam thing down there in O.Noir's dark and dingy basement dining room.

Seriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.

First off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful, crappy food. In a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.

I ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.

Speaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.

The seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.

Sitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.

Although we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.

On the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.

O.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway. I was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark...,15,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

Came here with my son to pick up an online order and to have him look at phones. I got my phone and that was that, no offer to help set it up or tell me about cool features, I had to ask. I could sense the reluctance but my phone was set up, then strong push for Direct TV and a home alarm.

No acknowledgement of my son who was looking at phones, whom I asked (in front of the agent) if he found something (he did). Still no acknowledgement, so we left. Will probably get it online or find a store more willing to help.

3011,Edq3REDbBfss0WQu2Ta93w,0,2015-09-04,0,-aUCxspfiYmRGi2iopGJrQ,1,My wife and I have been eating at this Zupa's (Happy Valley) for almost a year.  When we first started eating there it was absolutely excellent.  Our last few visits, today and last week were not good at all.  First off the salad bowl used to be filled almost to the top with greens, last two visits there were a good 1 1/2 from the top (really?) of course the condiments are alwyas put on with a tiny baby spoon, usually not even half full of content, but I get that and am ok with that, but what also doesn't seem right is that if you get a large size salad, you still get the small size condiments?  Additionally, the honey mustard dressing must have been diluted because it has absolutely no taste and of course was minimally applied.  Another major concern is that while eating the salad, it seemd very gritty, almost like there was sand or dirt on the leaves?  Bad taste as well.  I used to get the lobster bisque but quite ordering that because it seemd that they putting more filler stuff celery etc. in it and less pieces of lobster.  The Tomato Basil is still very good so that's my go to for soup, assuming we ever go back.
As for customer service?  Spotty at best.  Today the server behind the counter at the soup ask if I wanted any soup, I said yes, a small Tamato Basil.  I got up to the register (very crowded) and there was no soup?  The server of the soup had this blank stare on her face like did you want soup?  Then the cash registers were not working properly and we stood at the counter with our soup getting colder by the minute and 4 to 5 minutes later we finally got to sit and eat.  Only other comment (not a good one) is that the water out of one of the soft drink dispenser tasted very bad?  Not sure why but certainly something to be concerned about.  Well, that's it folks!  We live in Anthem and don't have a lot of great resturants in the ares so we are very sad that this place is seemingly going to hell in a hand basket!!,1,3PzZdVYJp2o-Fkx5TfcmbQ

Really enjoyed the ramen.  Large bowls brimming with tasty goodness.   Note, some bowls have more meat and toppings than others.

Gyozas are also very good and appear to be made in restaurant as opposed to the frozen bought variety.  

Chicken wings were also very good however last time they came undercooked.

Maybe it was a bad day to go in, since I walked in on Boxing Day, and it was one of the only open cafes. I might give it a do over after I'm done with the rest of my Indie Coffee Passport stops, but I'm not in any rush.

I enjoyed the space itself though, that wide open emptiness. My table was covered in magazines (so if you don't bring reading material, you're more than covered), they have wifi and I read and finished a book without interruption (it's quiet). I'd probably go back eventually, buy a coffee I might not even like, solely to hang around. Maybe that's why there isn't much seating, there is a certain dark homey comfort to this place I can't quite put my finger on, but I like it.

While I'm happy they offer soy AND almond milk, I don't like that they charge extra for it.,3,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ

+ They're a hole-in-the-wall joint.  That means little to no traffic, cozy, fast.

+ Simple menu.  It really bugs me when coffee shops have a hundred-and-one different drinks up on the board.  Seattle Espresso's menu does not mess with your mind.

-/+ The baristas are average.  Most of the time I come in and they're friendly, but once I had a guy treat me like I wasn't even there.  His friend came in and they started talking... while he was making my drink and when I paid.

+++ I LOVE THEIR DRINKS.  Their espresso is smooth and blends well.  Their cup sizes are decent.  They have very unique flavors, my favorite being the white mocha.  The coffee experience here is sublime, to say the least.,5,dnSBTYaCnKk_zxjAic1QEQ

We sat in the bar area and weren't greeted for about 15-20mins. No big deal, we order our drinks and that takes about another 15 mins to arrive. The server brings drinks to the table next to us and drops the entire tray of drinks and the lady behind me... I'm not talking a little water. The poor lady is covered in drinks. The server immediately apologies and runs off leaving the spilled drinks all over the floor and table. I kid you not that spilled mess sat on the floor for 30 mins before ANYONE came over. No manager came to apologize to the lady right away and all the did was give her a free appetizer! Terrible customer service, the manager addressed the lady as the one who got drinks spilled on. How about you learn some manners, sir! 

Anyways, after 50 minutes of sitting there we finally see our server again to take our order. The food came and what do you... it's super crappy tasting! I'll take my $50 for 2 people and go else where... like the Bell Rd location. This place sucks, so bad.,1,2A9ox9p8iodBVx20Dhr-fg

Liked that the screen is easier to read. Nice printed menus too. Purchased a Groupon  (4 burgers 4 sides) gave our orders (one burger and side to go) and was charged $26 and change. I'll take credit for signing and paying albeit confused, my mistake. Apparently lady assumed I only purchased a Groupon for (2 burgers and 2 sides). I pointed that out, she (lady 1) needed help and the lady (lady 2) who helped only asked the cash registrar for an explanation, not me. No sorry no nothing. Immediate refund of $21 no questions asked. I asked why it was only $21 not $26 and change, a brief and now obviously fake glance at the screen and I was told registrar was right not me. Lady 2 walks to the back and cancels 2 burgers and 2 sides. I patiently wait cause I understood the kitchen was busy and there was a line. I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies, didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen. Lady 1 put in an order for the other 2 burgers and 2 fries (one to go) offered me 2 free drinks which I declined.

Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland, both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.'

As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.

Last week I told my sisters to eat here. Just sent a message on group chat telling them not to waste their time. Few weeks ago told my coworkers to stop by here when they're in the neighborhood, I'll tell them about this visit on Monday.

My advice to management: Tell staff to read, slow down, listen and understand how important customer service is.

But you really need to order the all you can eat because the portions on the plate of meat are too little for the amount you're paying.  The all you can eat is around $25 / person & everyone at your table has to eat all you can eat or no one can order it. If you order the all you can eat then you don't have to pay extra for rice (which you really shouldn't have to do if you put in an order for meat--but that's just my opinion).

Seoul Grill recently revised their menu, so there are more options for different meats. They have added different flavors, which are so yummy! Try to spicy pork belly (sam gyop sal) that was recently added it's one of my favorites.

And remember when eating meat first order not marinated meats then order marinated because otherwise the marinated meats taste will disrupt the taste of the not marinated meat.   

I must say it's really nice not having to drive to Koreatown for a decent korean bbq place!

Oh and all the people who work here are so nice & helpful! I wish they would make a Seoul Grill in Surprise! We need a korean restaurant in Surprise!,2,WgbbxTRIy7MwDKn7nL5WKQ

My husband has been going to Ama for about a year now for his hair cuts. He will not go to anyone else. She is very meticulous and always does an incredible job. I finally took his advice and had a haircut done by Ama yesterday... I am amazed by the quality of services she rendered!! She understood exactly what I was looking for. I had a gloss treatment done as well and now my hair is as shiny, healthy, and lustrous as it's ever been.

I would absolutely recommend Ama if you are looking for a quality haircut!!!,2,hvZ5o9YNJJ-TVCcdT42VoQ

-/+ Service is a 50/50.  Some baristas are awesome, some I'd like to slap back into reality.

- Prices suck.  At 3 Roots I tried the pita/veggie plate and it was definitely not worth the nine bucks.  A few slices of carrots, broccoli and celery, a dab of hummus and a stale pita.  Gross.

+ Vanilla latte.  At least they know how to make the most generic latte in the world.

The indoor pool area is great, with shower facilities and a locker room that are clean and a good temperature for freezing kids getting out of the pool.  The pool is an Olympic sized pool and is not kept freezing (like at MAC) but is cool enough for the children not to overheat.  The deep end has a ledge around the sides that the children can stand on while receiving instruction.  There are several diving blocks they practice on as well.  The seating is great... concrete bleacher-like seating that is in the pool area and divided by a smallish wall.  While the area does have a strong chlorine smell, it is nothing like other area YMCAs that have the indoor pools and water parks... my eyes do not sting while there nor do my clothes smell when we leave.  And, while it is warm in there (thank Goodness!), it is not sweltering.  The parking is awesome here.  There is never a crowd.

Ok, on to the instruction, which is great... I have enrolled a 4 year old and a 9 year old in this program.  My 4 year old could doggie paddle and swim just well enough to jump off the diving board, my 9 year old needed a refresher for the swim team and was mostly doing illegal strokes that would get her disqualified in a meet.  The lessons are at 6 week intervals, which is nice as really long-term commitments freak me out a bit (commitment phobe!).  They are so reasonably prices compared to what we have paid at the stand alone swim centers, I almost felt guilty.  This guilt increased when I found that my 9 year old was in a class with only one other child. The instructor was fantastic!  He pushed them enough to work hard but feel accomplished.  And he got her strokes totally straightened out (no more lifting her head to take a breath in freestyle).  We did 2 sessions (one 6 weeks, the other 5 weeks (even better for my commitment issues)), and my daughter ended up in the All Star swim meet after summer swim team.  Which was a bonus, I just did not want her to be embarrassed swimming.  The 4 year old?  After one 6 week session, she was doing a version of freestyle, jumping off the diving board and I felt totally safe letting her swim this summer without having to be in the pool with her at every moment.  

We will be there this Winter doing their little Winter league swim team.  Look for us, I will be the mom reading her book on the concrete bleachers and my daughters will be the ones splashing around and having a blast!,4,OQT9DjfBrzrwOEdVJjuYIA

I used to travel alot and Mcdonalds was always the go to fast food restaurant for us. Always consistant food and fast convenient service.

This branch is a very poorly run store. The last few times I have gone thru the drive thru the man taking the order was very rude. (the same person i think).. Could not seem to awnser any questions or be polite in any such way. And the food was sub par.

Two nights ago, we went to grab a quick snack wrap.. We were greated by a big man who had a very poor attitude. I thought maybe he was just having a bad night?? As we pulled to the counter to grab our order a car from the drive thru went around us to leave. He actually yelled at the man who takes orders that he needed to learn how to treat customers. I then knew that the rudeness that was suspected was not just my imagination.. 

Tonight was the absolute last time I will ever go here.. We went thru the drive thru around 12:00 AM and for some reason the man who normally takes the order said that they would be closed for 15 minutes for a break??? This is supposed to be a 24 hour location. I wasn't sure if he said 15 or 50 minute break so I asked him when they would re-open to have him yell 15 back in the headset? Some seriously bad service. 
 
I will pass the word on that this location has inconsistant food and horrible service. The management at this fast food branch should be fired as well as the employees who seem to think that yelling at customers and treating them poorly is okay to do.,0,hvZ5o9YNJJ-TVCcdT42VoQ

I spent a lot of time with the person at the front desk, making sure that I was matched with someone who would take the time to get to know me and the hair style that I wanted to achieve.  I was booked the following week with 2 different stylists.  One for hair color and another for a cut.  I showed up ON TIME.  I waited 15 minutes for the the colorist (Lauren) to greet me and start services.  I asked to speak to the lady who was going to cut my hair.  Everyone was rushed and no-one wanted to take the time to get to know me.  The colorist starting applying the color to my hair and informed me that there was not enough time for my hair cut. If I wanted to get my hair cut, I could come back another day or she could cut my hair.  The rudeness was unbelievable.  I was really looking forward to trying a new salon and stylist.  After much discussion, the manager came over and apologized.  I explained that the cut was the most important part of the day. Because there was not enough time for both, I opted to have the color washed out of my hair and have my hair cut with the person (leah) who I was scheduled with for the cut.  I waited 45 minutes for her, which meant I could have continued with the hair color and been fine with timing.  I came back the next day for Leah to color my hair. She barely said 5 words to me.  I paid $20 more for her to color my hair for a total of $85 for a root touch up.  There was NO offer by the salon for compensation for that fact that I had to come back to the salon TWICE.  The manager was nice and apologetic, but the attitude of the stylists was appalling.,4,o40GNTpHdXFLCh5J34wQ6A

Service is always friendly and helpful, reasonably quick, and they don't use a microwave to heat up your samosas - which some other Indian restaurants do in the area. Ew. 

I've had curry bowls from here in the past and like everyone has said, the curries are quite bland.  They are spiced but not really (especially if you've gotten used to more authentic little India flavours) and just generally have a healthy flavor to them. it's not terrible, but miss-able. 

I'd recommend the vegetable samosas instead (or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice.) They do bake them - so they aren't deliciously deep fried, but still the filling is nice.

They've recently upped the price of the samosas, but 3 samosas and two chutneys will still only run you just under $5.,2,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ

Because I'm strictly a film photographer, I was looking to find a store that would offer great support in terms of my analog needs. I tried one other place in the city and was disappointed by their crappy customer service and the fact that they kept their film stock hidden away from view. 

Not at Downtown Camera. With a wall made of vintage cameras and a range of films right out in the open, I knew this was going to be a good fit.

Not only do they have E6 outlab services, their turnaround time for film processed in-house is quick, and you can receive text or email updates to know when your film is ready. And they offer a punch card (for in-house developing only) to keep track of the film you've dropped off -
 once you've hit your ninth roll, your tenth is free! 

Seriously, if you are still shooting film, are only shooting film, or just getting into shooting film, this is your go-to lab and photo store! With so many places choosing to only cater to digital shooters and doing away with film processing altogether, we need to take care of the stores that are taking care of us! Make your film cameras happy, come into Downtown Camera! :)

*UPDATE*
As I've been taking more and more advantage of the film processing services at Downtown Camera, I've become aware of a few issues that I find problematic. Thus why I've felt the need to alter my original review. First, the customer service is very touch and go. Some days I go in, and it's fantastic. Other days, it's as if the person behind the counter is going through the motions. The assistance you receive is never consistent, and that's pretty much a bummer. Second, and even more disheartening, is the fact that next day film service at Downtown Camera is now three or even four days processing time, something that seemed to have started within the past month. I inquired about it possibly being due to a large influx of film to be processed, but the person behind the counter claimed that this was the norm. Not sure how next day can be advertised as such, but I do know that there are other film processing places in TO that will develop your film either that day or the very next day, dependent on how early in the morning you drop off, and that is their regular service. Just a few things to consider when assessing your film processing needs.,2,XoiBk3HfY0F5WSBgDPZFog

We split the tofu tod for an appetizer. Panko coated and fried tofu with a crazy good sweet/spice dipping sauce. The tofu was well seasoned (its easy for fried things to go bland and this didn't) and had great texture. 

I had chicken pad thai. For $13 it was a generous portion. It came out piping hot and with a perfect level of spice (I requested on the mild side of medium, which isn't easy to nail).

I also tried my husband's massaman curry with chicken, sweet potato, and peanut. It was phenomenal, really rich from coconut milk with great flavor and heat. 

The service here wasn't bad, but they're definitely still learning. Our waitress mentioned that her brother opened the restaurant with his wife, and I'm happy to support a family business while they sort out the kinks.

They looked at a old water softener system that was no longer functional. After discussion, they suggested a new system that provides softening and filtration.  I did NOT feel pressured for purchase.  Instead, they gave me all the information and allowed me to make my own decision.  After giving the thumbs up, they were back in a couple of hours SAME DAY with the new system and got it all installed.  All questions I had about other repairs on the property (replacing outdoor piping, checking for leaks, etc) were answered without ego or frustration.

Another problem they found was I had a leak in my laundry room that had been present for quite some time.  It caused damage to the drywall and required repair.  They referred me to an excellent service and repaired the leak by installing new valves.

A couple days later, after moving in and getting my washer and dryer installed, I called AFTERHOURS and was surprised to get a callback almost immediately.  They came out next day to install the gas line for my dryer and check my gas fireplace quickly.

She said 'I'm a hairdresser,' and instantly my connection with Christian was born. 

I have just read the other stellar reviews of Christian on this site, and found myself nodding and smiling in agreement with all of them. I will add that I have never in my life had a hairdresser who was so caring and concerned about understanding what I want for my hair, then working to give it to me and 'get it right.' Christian is a beautiful person, inside and out, and I feel as if my appoinments with her are also  visits with a friend. 

Not to mention that she is a kick-ass, super-talented stylist and my hair has never looked better! I was leaving the salon the other day after Christian did my hair and the next customer commented that I looked 'really hot! Now that is the kind of compliment you want to hear after just having your hair done (especially when you're in your 50's!) Love, love, love!!!,0,6Kwhv2QHfGCtK6VHYIZFqQ

Have been back twice since (both times at night) and have actually had a nice time. The ambiance is really warm and inviting, the music choice is pretty great and the bartenders are knowledgeable and attentive.

Our server recommended the Cold Sweaty Noodle (I forget the exact name of this dish) it was my favourite of the night, good spice, light, and packed with raw veggies. The broths are definitely different from any other place you will try, but it was an interesting change... not necessarily lacking in flavour as other reviews might suggest, just different. They had a bit more of an acidic flavour. The staff there seemed generally confused and overwhelmed, but they will probably get into the groove of things in a few months. Not one of my top picks, but I look forward to coming back and trying some other items on their menu.,0,c7YlnErSRpkD7fnrCw_a6Q

I figured it was fate:) I purchased the 2 dozen cake pops for $25 deal and then scheduled my order the next
Day. I wasnt picky,  just requested whatever colors and flavors I could get for the deal and not have to pay anything extra.  I went yesterday after work to pick up the pops and was thoroughly impressed with the end results! Not only were the cake pops ready when I arrived, but they were absolutely darling! Definitely above and beyond what I expected for my $25 deal. I couldnt resist trying one (the shower is tonight) and as I thought they taste amazing as well. Well done Michelle!

Maybe it was the beef (which did arrive cooked perfectly), or maybe it was just that the kaya sauce just didn't jive with the fried egg, pickles, and avocado.  Whatever it was, while I enjoyed the burger (great bun, and delicious fries), it didn't WOW me like I had hoped it would.

The interior is super cute, and the service was good though the kitchen was slow.  That gave me more time to drink, which is always fine, though Kaya's bar was a little on the light side for worthwhile beers.

3.5 stars, rounded down, but I will without question be stopping by Kaya next time I'm through Pittsburgh to try some of their other menu items.  I expect great things.,0,OxE0QBa6m1399S8BXigIsg

Highlights of the market are the wonderful fresh food, trying all the awesome cheese samples (curds, fried cheese, aged cheese, etc.). Doesn't get much better than the fried cheese. Great pastries/bakery items too - hot and spicy cheese break, donuts, muffins, scones, etc. I've also bought vegetable plants from the market and they've seemed to turn out better than ones you buy from home depot or somewhere like that.

They're great with coupons; you'll almost never pay full price for a haircut.  This explains why I got my haircut there so many times.  Each visit was more bizarre than the time before.  The last time that I went to Dean's, two of the stylists lectured me on the 'bad' product that I used on my hair (a bumble and bumble product...).  

Overall, my haircuts were never good.  Mehh at best.  I've been to three different stylists there and only one of them spoke to me while cutting my hair.  That can be an awkward hour long hair cut... And the salon is dirty.  Maybe my standards are too high, but if I'm getting my eyebrows waxed, I believe that the hair should be wiped off of the chair.  Or that there shouldn't be noticeable dust bunnies all over the salon.  There are just so many better salons in Pittsburgh (MCN), please don't waste your money here.,0,nZpcyQaEQzvUpnbjK0cQIg

2696,SW6ZQk22G1_CV81_gfnvNQ,0,2016-10-13,0,4Z9GOnIZSCuCLnArBRoPAA,1,I've been to this place twice, more than once was a mistake.  When they were a street operation, albeit a semi-legal one, it was really cool, novel - people would line up for days.  The tacos were $3 apiece, and it was a unique and fun experience. 

Ever since they got fixed locations though, I am very unimpressed.  I have slight hearing loss and the environment in this place is not conducive to any form of conversation - the music is all rap and hip hop and seriously and intensely loud.  I don't mind the style of music at all and am happy to eat tacos to A Tribe Called Quest, but at airplane-taking-off decibel levels? I was with a group and couldn't hear a word of what was being said, made me feel stupid and isolated.  Asking for music to be turned down was disregarded - 'this is our brand' was what I got in return.  Gross.  Service was slow and weirdly pretentious given the aesthetic they are trying to cultivate.

As per the tacos - overpriced and way small.  No lies, the cod fish is a decent two bites, but the carnita, cotija and beef cheek taste very boring - like more boring than ground beef with a 99 cent taco mix packet boring.  You could eat ten of them easily and still be hungry, which sets you back over $60 - the price/food ratio is rough and both times I left hungry, poorer, and disappointed.

The cherry on top is that this place is run by misogynists who think it is funny to make taco puns at the expense of women.  They have done this multiple times, and I am certain will continue to do so despite overtures to the public.  But hey, it's just locker room talk, right? 

On food quality, ambiance, and price, there are many, many better options for tacos in Toronto - I would skip this one.,7,fsUMORfhG2rwE7rX8uYmmQ

A former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.

Inside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...

This restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.

With that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.

Well to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.

A variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a soufflé of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.

One benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.

Quite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.,5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

These are similar to tapioca / bubble tea balls / boba except they are flavored (mango, passion fruit, etc) juice surrounded with a thin coating. These things POP in your mouth. They are great, everyone should try them out. 

They offer many different flavors of frozen yogurt (~roughly 5-6: green tea, pomegranate, plain, strawberry, taro, and some others)

Final note, everyone but one person that I've brought here enjoys this place.,4,sNUD7INzDJYtuj6jAuIMRg

Nice thin crust with a good amount of cheese. Made in a stone oven. 

2) Broccolini and sausage pasta ($13)
Linguini was al dente, generous amount of sausage and broccolini. Good portion. 

The restaurant is a nice space. The decor was well done. The prices are a bit high for lunch but for dinner, this would be a good option.,0,UGW-9bbBEB3eP1o6mWD_WA

When ordering burgers, the first selections that we made were not available so I settled on a Bison Burger. It was not much to speak of from the bun to the toppings or even the meat itself. It wasn't memorable or particularly tasty. The french fries I tried seemed overdone and like they had been sitting out.

Frankly. I would not recommend this place. My meal left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. The food was not that good and the service also left something to be desired. The restaurant was a little dark, uncomfortable booths, and didn't have a nice atmosphere.... If you're in the area, you'd be better off at Red Robin,,0,djSJ6a9gsLSdj-7BoyNNQA

The flavors are somewhat mediteranean and they've got a great menu.  Their cocktails are fabulous, I love their white peach belini and my husband is crazy about their dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.  The bread basked comes with fresh baked onion foccacia and two kinds of olive tapenade.  They have some really good apps, including a great ahi tartare and some really nice flatbreads (one with proscuitto and figs, another with mushrooms, and a great classic tomato-basil-mozarella).  Favs on the dinner menu include the scallops (perfectly seared, served with risotto), the butternut squash tortellini, and the chestnut ravioli (served on a bed of creamed spinach-heavenly!).  Do not skip dessert here- they have a souflee that is crazy good.  Flavors change but the strawberry is incredible, so is the vanilla.  My husband and I order two, that's how delicious they are.  Service here is always great, very attentive.  I recommend sitting on the patio, it's much more private and has a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and water show.  Definitely make reservations or you could be waiting 2 hours for a table.,1,dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg

They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!! Way to go CMS even though we regularly attend races here you now have a customer for life!,1,Cxv3SNudPrCavvHJfIbwhQ

It was a 3 hour camp and when I realized it was only 4 days instead of 5, the value of this camp sharply decreased... oh!  but wait a minute... they released a coupon for pay for one child and the second goes free!  Score!  This only worked for me because I had not paid for our session yet.  Had I already paid, this deal would not have applied.  Imagine how disappointed my responsible, early-paying friend was when she realized the offer was not available to her!

The camp itself was well run and organized.  The art work was adorable.  My daughter had a great time and did not get too messy!  They also gave them fun snacks.

The camp is advertised for up to age 10 but my free 10 year old only went twice as it is really geared toward the younger children.,1,OQT9DjfBrzrwOEdVJjuYIA

I love that no animals are killed for this fur, and the quality is exceptional.  They have fab pillows, rugs, and various accents for the home- as well as some pretty cute sweaters.  I've also gotten some handmade moccasins and a horseshoe hook here, designed by a local artist in Boulder City.  Prices are on the high side (which is typical for alpaca), but the men that work here (owners, I'm guessing) have been accommodating at lowering the price (especially when you buy several items).

Once they started to get more known and got busy, their service started to suck and their portion sizes got cut in half. I have a huge problem with paying MORE for way less food. The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew? Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money.

I wanted to order a latte macchiato, and I don't think the lady at the cashier knew they even have this drink at first. She first put cafe latte on the machine, and I saw it and corrected it. Then I was trying to personalize my drink a bit with less ice and almond milk. After I finished my request, the lady asked me again whether I was ordering a caramel macchiato. I corrected her again that I wanted a latte macchiato. Okay, then it finally showed the right drink on the cashier. I thought this was the end of the story but NO. The guy who was making my drink held a manual with his left hand the entire time while he was making my drink with only his right hand. I even saw him made a mistake at first and started over for my drink. Finally, I got my drink, but the taste was not good as it should taste since I had the same drink several times from another Starbucks store at CU. I understand this is a new Starbucks store, and they are obviously new hires who need a lot of practice. But they clearly need more training before serving real customers. How can employees not even remember the drinks on the menu (I'm definitely not ordering a very wired customized drink)? I hope the manager can pay more attention to the training standards of the employees.,0,fT5JZrpDTc4_j9MW5h6jPQ

Long story short. I have to get a hair cut by today, can't wait due to scheduling issue. Found this one near by, decided to give it a try. 

Sgro's doesn't go by appointments. I walked in around 5:05, the shop closes at 5:30. They took their time to meet my specific request for my hair style. By the time was done, it was already pass the closing time. The outcome is clean and neat.

Initially I meant to get one of this restaurants famous crepes, however after learning they served breakfast until 2pm and spying their new breakfast menu, I found I simply could not resist their house omelette with prosciutto & Brie!! Two of my favorite special foods in one perfect omelette. 
I arrived at what must be one of their busiest times, and after some initial confusion as to who was lining up for take out and who was lining up to be seated I joined the correct line and waited only about 4-5 mins before a very pleasant hostess greeted me. 
I was on my own and was seated immediately at a lovely, comfortable corner booth/table. Guessing they would be too busy to make it to me quickly I put my coffee order in with her. By the time I returned from the bathroom (v well kept!) a server was bringing my coffee order. 
I had had a chance to review the menu while waiting and put my order in immediately.  The male server was friendly and efficient and I was left to my own devices to wait for my food. I watched the staff moving back and forth in this small establishment with ease and dexterity realizing they had a well oiled machine! I looked around and appreciated the simple decor was very clean & well maintained. 
My server came over with more coffee apologizing for the delay (a party of 6 had been seated just before me, but after he returned to my table with more cream another server brought my dish out! (Also apologizing) I should note that I did not feel like I had been waiting long at all. 
It was beautifully plated with a very fresh spinach and mixed greens salad and the gorgeous, thick balsamic dressing in a tiny metal dispenser on the side. My choice of toast was also served up, perfectly toasted and buttered just slightly so as to also enjoy a side of jam. 
My meal was excellent and very well priced at $11.50, and, as only a good meal can I left with a big smile on my face despite the rainy day I walked out to.,0,VcGRlOctwTS-ZFXwVK211A

I happen to be in the store the day she came in trying to pick up her table on that Sunday. Her paperwork clearly said Monday and she had the wrong day. In fact I had to stop getting customer service so they could help her. She was yelling through the store and cussing at them using profanity I had my children in there. Total white trash is how she acted. I had to stay in the store until after they closed because of her stunt going over to the other store. She went to pick up her table at the 59th Ave. and Bell location she put it in her truck and she left and never paid for.  The owners daughter on the E. Bell Rd. location called her several times as I was sitting right in front of her. Rik never picked up her phone. I would say in the 15 minutes before she called the police she had to have called for probably 10 times. She knew she owed the money when she loaded the table she should have paid for it then. Howie world was left with nothing left but to call the police to protect themselves. I have never seen someone in my life be so rude to people in a store as this Riki was. Howie world was not rude to her or mean to her. She wanted them to deliver something on a different day and hour before closing. And it simply could not have been done. Riki Did not read her paperwork for the delivery date she messed up and she wanted them to take the blame for it And she drove the other location picked up the merchandise and didn't pay for.

The more upscale froyo places such as pinkberry and yoforia definitely are better than Fruiticup, but since there isn't a lot of other froyo options in the university area I would def recommend trying this place.

3411,7Us3dn3v9o2xMSXA6qztLg,1,2014-11-23,1,yhYXBKT6qC8WZ3Eq1M7HDQ,2,First time trying Paramount Fine Foods - heard both positive and negative things about their other locations and had to try this for myself. 

This is their newest location. They had been open a few weeks when I visited with a large group of friends. The good news is they were able to accommodate the large party on short notice. The staff were polite, but because it was so busy they were not as attentive as I would have liked. We had to make several requests for garnishes, drinks and cutlery. 

The nightmare came when it came time to order. You had to navigate yourself through the crowds of people to the other side of the restaurant to place your order. They had so many staff around I don't understand why they don't have table service. The nightmare continued when the food took over 45 minutes for everyone to receive their food. Some orders came within 15 minutes, others took up to 45 minutes. By the time the last people received their food the first group of people already finish their dinners. 

I was one of the first ones to receive their dinner but it was cold. The beef was very tough - couldn't stab it with a fork and had to use my hands. The rice was quite bland and the salad wilted. I also tried the butter chicken pizza which was ok. Mixed reviews from the other people we were dining with as well - the grilled chicken was good as was the other barbecued items. some of the other pizzas that they had tried we're also just okay. One of the only highlights was the pita bread that was brought to our table when we arrived - it was piping hot. 

Maybe it's just growing pains. I will give another location a second chance.,2,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ
907,70umoFq_Wa24Nr78UOsilQ,0,2011-10-16,0,R_7XYxXrJ7nZ0_Tdj9ns9A,4,I crave Ono from time to time.  I wish it was closer to my apartment.  I still swing by for some Chicken Katsu whenever I get the chance, because it is tasty and delicious and katsu sauce is addictive.  My boyfriend is more adventurous than me, and he literally always is in the mood to go here.  He especially enjoys the spare ribs, bbq combo, and the spam musubi.  We both love the macaroni salad...  I get why someone said there was too much mayo, and I guess by some standards it's a little plain, but that's what I like about it.  People who say the rice is boring are obviously right, but they're forgetting to put soy sauce or katsu sauce or whatever they want on it.  It's plain white rice, guys, what do you think it's going to taste like?  

They also have these super tasty canned Hawaiian beverages at the counter that we both highly recommend.  

Oh, and if you have a smaller appetite, definitely go for the smaller plate option.  My eyes tend to be larger than my stomach and I can never finish the full-sized katsu plate, but the smaller one is just right (actually still a little more than I can eat, usually) and it's only about $5.  Awesome.,0,vbe6VKvvOHn0BkqAhhmEmw

I ordered a chicken dish that had a creamy sauce, some potatoes, and asparagus. It was a great dish, served hot. It had way more complex flavors than I was expecting. I also tried a bite of the pasta with vegetables.

548,WB8BmFMORvshjb7tBw0e0Q,1,2007-10-02,0,SRSZMo-NciWnrcls2kHGmA,5,Without question, the best, and most authentic, Mexican restaurant in town. We're not talking Mexico City Mexican, we're talking Baja California Mexican.

The menu is quite simple and the food is awesome. The margaritas are small, potent, and pricey - but worth it.

My favorite dishes include: the shrimp cocktail appetizer with chips (good for sharing), and the mahi-mahi fish tacos. The burritos are huge and also recommended - try the surf n turf, wet (red sauce). It is enough for 2 to share (especially if you have starters).

No reservations are accepted, so if you go on a Fri or Sat night, be prepared to have a few cocktails at the bar.

Also, if you are a fan of chains like Mad Mex or Don Pablos, I wouldn't recommend trying Azul. You will come out of this place saying the prices are too high and the portions are too small. 

If you prefer quality over quantity, Azul cannot be beat (unless you fly to LA or head south of the border).,2,AlzerMK7z84E4KU6GjPzIQ

Find a place that cares about your big day as much as you do. Superstition Manor only wants your money, and they aren't even willing to work that hard for it. Really pathetic experiences the more we got to know them. 

We spent a lot of money and made our wedding look good, but still got treated poorly, and worse our guests were treated poorly. It was like we worked for them and not the other way around. A $10K or even $20K+ event shouldn't be a DIY experience in which the staff is rude and a hinderance to pulling off the day the bride dreams of.

 I was referred here by a friend and at first thought Korean and Mexican?? WEIRD... i dont know... but my husband and I were in the area and thought why not, lets try it... after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place. We tried the chimichanga and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.... We actually did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef (have you EVER been to a place that will make a burrito half and half? i havent!) The meat has fantastic flavor. I'm not a beef girl but i'd order a whole plate of their beef - its that good. The chimichanga was HUGE enough for both of us to share it (and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious) and we were FULL and it was $11 total with drinks. YOu cant beat that.

THe service was great. The server was so nice and attentive- you could tell she was the owner. 

The only thing I'd change is their chips they serve. They were burnt, too thick and kind of bland but their salsa is great. And lets face it, i'm fat so I we ate two baskets anyway so they cant be that bad. lol

All in all, food was delicious, A LOT of food for cheap, great prices, great service great flavor. Hell even my burps taste delicious. Bahaha!,0,msQe1u7Z_XuqjGoqhB0J5g

2414,dJzRwJytL1ECqYA98aHQaQ,2,2011-10-14,0,KBOeSOkkcY50DF9faLXQ5Q,3,I have eaten pizza here twice. It's good restaurant with fun decor. 

The food last night was decent, but I do think I could have made it at home with Jamie Oliver's Italian cook book. It's not too expensive, however, so long as you moderate your alcohol, which justifies going there. It can also be fun, with the nod to the retro decor and interesting hipster patrons an staff. Our hostess was great and the waitress not so good (didn't ask how things were until the meal was almost done, didn't ask me if I wanted another drink, etc.). 

The rustic style pizzas do remind me more of true Italian pizza than one would normally expect of a North American pizza joint. The name Magpie, after the bird, is a very commonwealth reference, which may seem odd at first. It is, however, one of a number of restaurants with British references that have opened in the past year or so in Montreal: e.g. Sparrow, Lawrence, Brit & Chips, the Burgundy Lion, etc. 

All in all, I will go back, but with moderate expectations.,5,rC7r9GvfBm_hk3QA0_vJDQ

Came a day before they opened and the lady at the cash was so friendly and welcoming. Came two days later and was not greeted at all. There was no way to tell where to order ...the guy near the food just looked at me with wide eyes. I asked for a mix plate (chicken n beef) he cuts the beef and asks me about my salad n rice choice. He adds the salad to the main part of the takeout container which is usually meant for rice. As for the rice..he litteraly gave me 3 regular size spoon fulls. Then adds the beef...i told him its mixed plate. He doesnt aknowledge. Removes some of the beef that already has tahini sauce on it and adds some chicken. I go to pay and the cashier is on his phone texting and i was visible to him. I ask if this is where i pay and he says yes and apologizes...i gave him a 20 and later realized he overcharged me by $3. The food taste was good but i would never go back. A new restaurant should embrace new customers and win them over forever. Interested to see how others were treated,3,2McB9CmWgZFlGWQozt6sOA

Everyone at this store was extremely professional and friendly. Keith understood what I needed and I felt comfortable about making the switch from Verizon after 14 years!!! Nicholas and Robbi (sp?) were knowledgeable and professional as well.

What a TERRIBLE experience.  One of the boys that worked there sold me the wrong part - after a while, a pool guy sent me back to get the right part. I went back and was told the boy doesn't work there anymore and what's in the past is in the past. 
Unbelievable. 
So, they slapped some old parts on my Hayward pool vac that the guy got out of his garage.  (I kid you not) And to rub salt in the wound, I had to pay $60 for more replacement parts.  As I was paying I asked so no apology? - no discount?.  The guy said nope.
So, those of you living in Morrison Ranch - you have been warned!

More often than not, we've gone there for brunch, and the service has been stellar. Not just hey they'll bring me my order the way I asked for it, but they'll do that AND be friendly, helpful, and fast. Service is great, they have on repeat occasions gone out of their way to be accommodating (without attitude).

A big one for me is they are vegan friendly (including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town) with most brunch items available veganized (and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lacto-ovo-vegetarian friendly too,) you sit where you want, you can play board games if you want, you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want, you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu (yes, they have one), or just check out what's on offer to drink on the chalkboard.

I'll also say, that the food is okay. Tofu scramble is hit or miss, but usually it's decent enough that even on it's worse. I've had worse tofu scrambles at places catering to vegetarians, so there is that.

I've gone with friends, I've gone with family, I've gone in pairs, I've gone in big groups. Go for brunch. It's great. Go for drinks, it's fun. 

Other stuff: Cash only (but there is an ATM inside), they have baked goods and cheesecake from Through Being Cool (vegan) bakery, and conveniently close to Nazareth Ethiopian restaurant (eat delicious Ethiopian food then go drinking).,0,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ

So first I get a gray Nissan Sentra I think it was and I was very unimpressed by the condition of the car. Then I'm driving on the highway and the car damn near stalls out on me and could have gotten me killed! I was close to the rental office so I took it back and demanded that I get a different car and be compensated for my troubles. I got a different car but instead of the company trying to make up for it and put me in something nicer they give me a car that had ink stains everywhere! As far as compensation goes the manger told me they would have to get it checked out as if I was making it up and after a few hours how did I know that they would call back and say nothing was wrong with the car?! Overall, I didn't like the whole rental experience from this company and never get in a gray Nissan! It might save your life!,0,zxCJAztRkzw4kDBxpwKWWg

The agent was rude, did not to her job in checking that the car was damaged (had to come up and tell her as she didn't take a look at the car whatsoever) and I was given a filthy vehicle that had dirt in the floor mats and bird poop on the chair in the back! Before I picked up the car, I asked what the 'other' charges were on my bill (amounted to about 1/3 of the price) and she didn't know. 
When I mentioned the car was dirty and had a strong smell, she told me I was wrong because she cleaned the car herself.
Any attempts to fix the situation with the location were fruitless as I was told multiple things by multiple people and nothing ever came of it for weeks even though I called back once a week to try and discuss the situation. I finally went through Avis' customer service who solved the issue and they provided excellent customer service.
I'd like to stress the following: as a company Avis is great, it's this particular location that seems to employ rude employees and is owned/managed by a woman whom they called Mrs. Mary who does not seem to value her customers or giving good service of any kind. There are plenty of other Avis locations to rent from in Montreal, please choose one of them instead!,2,oClSop924pYiEwnm_Et_6Q

Got the $50 prefix menu, also used the Costco gift certs... so definitely a great great value. Value:5 Star 

Location: Just plain weird, had to triple check the address on the navi to make sure we arrived at the right location. Location: 2 star 

Decor: No bad.. not great, although the open kitchen was both a plus and minus. Very interactive and fun with the... but the smell of the grill and some of the seafood was just overwhelming at certain times. Our clothing smelled semi-fishy from sitting at a table so close to the kitchen. 
Decor/layout: 3 star. 

Food: Major bummer. Let me just say, I never had rosemary's, I got nothing against them. Perhaps my expectation was too high... the food just didn't do it for me. 

-Hugo's BBQ shrimp and blue cheese slaw: Too salty, over cooked stiff shrimp. 
-Duo tar tar: Nicely done 
-Scallops and the Halibut were the best dishes of the night. Very Good 
-Meats were a major disappointment. 
The Veal Porter house was very tender but tasteless, very salty on the outside, but very bland on the inside. 
Rack of lamb were not bad, but not great either, portions were very small too. 
For dessert, we got the chocolate cream pie (very good), apple tart (very good), Bread pudding (super bad.... tasted like a doughy sponge... no we didn't finish it) and banana cheese cake (way too sweet). Over all food: 3 Star 

Service: Wonderful. We didn't have the heart to complain about the less than stellar taste to such wonder servers. 

Over all Rosemary's is not a bad restaurant, but I don't think it deserves the 4.5 star rating on yelp. Maybe they just had a off night, maybe my expectations were to high. We're from Calif, having to convince my wife and in laws to drive off the strip to eat at a 4.5 yelped restaurant for some delicious fine dinning... we were disappointed.,0,BF7dfuWmdb0TZyKpNlnr-Q

This was delicious the sauce had good body and had real body with great taste. The large noodles were great with good portions. It was perfect did not over eat and was so good I finished every bit.

4851,Yemfgx9S_UzK9Rbqpbl6nA,1,2013-08-20,3,lr5blFSZWDqTLHuSyQtmsA,1,My husband and I found this business at the Arizona home show.  The owner was very nice and the company was licensed and bonded so we thought we were in good hands.  We had the owner come and look at our brand new home and give us an estimate of painting the inside of our home.  The price was reasonable and being that we found this company at the home show and because the company was licensed and bonded we hired them to do the job.  We were told the job would take 4 days and we checked on the progress every day.  Again this is our brand new never lived in home, on the last day of painting we checked on the progress only to find the painting was completed along with major damage to our brand new shower.  The owner did not call us when the damage occured and when we contacted him he fessed up and apologized that one of his workers had fallen off a ladder and broke an entire slab of stone in our shower and promised to take care of the damage.  When we asked why we were not told when it happened the owner said he was trying to come up with a solution first.  Seemed odd to us we werent told immediately but let it go.  We then had to get the original stone installers to our new home for an estimate and provided the estimate to the painter.  The owner of the company did send us a check for the difference of what we owed him and the damage to our stone which is still not yet fixed as it had to be ordered so we have been without a shower now for over two weeks.

We thought this would all be behind us and that it was just an unfortunate accident that wasnt handled very well.  That was until we found further damage to the outside of our home.  It was obvious more damage was done by the companies workers!  They had dragged a pallet of paint from our gate to our back door in our backyard.  The pallet was left in our backyard and we were able to trace the lines the pallet made all the way to its last ending point.  Based on the tracks it appears the workers pushed the pallet around the corner of our house and pulled so hard it removed the stucco and paint from the side of our BRAND NEW house.  

I was never advised of this damage either and when we emailed the owner of the company we never received a response.  We are beyond dissatisfied with this company based on the damage they did to our home not once, but twice and how it was handled.  We have never written a review on a company before and have never been so dissatisfied and wanted to warn others of our experience with this company.  Our suggestion although the price may be reasonable choose another company for any painting needs BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY!,3,sm532xNx-vSRO9CMcfqVZw

It was busy 4 of the 5 times we went (Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening visits). If you have a group, make reservations because otherwise you'll be packed into a corner sharing a table with 2 or 3 people. 

Waffles and crepes were really good. I had a waffle topped with fruit and a scoop of their vanilla ice cream (which I heard was made in house, not commercial brand). Very good! My friend has the crepe with chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce - also very good!

Another occasion we had the hot chocolate with a slice of chocolate cake. Hot chocolate was really good. The cake slice was huge. I feel that they could reduce the price (which was pricy as is!) and serve a smaller portion. This is definitely a share sized piece of cake - but you're stuck with just one variety if you're with a date. Table beside us had a group of 3 who ordered 3 slices and left about half of their cake behind.

I don't love oysters but I actually liked this. The batter was crispy and thin and the oysters weren't dried out.

6-pack - $12
The outside of the nori was encrusted with...I want to say it was panko. It didn't look like deep fried sushi rice on the outside to me.

Spicy tuna 2 styles - $6
The pieces on the far left/right were spicy and the inside pieces were plain. Reminded me of bruschetta. But better.

Wild Jumbo Shrimp Tempura - $8
I don't mind wasabi but I wish it was on the side. Otherwise, I liked the big shrimp and the batter.

Mini Okonomiyaki - $6
Nothing spectacular, but a bit too much bonito flakes

Yaki Scallop - $12
These scallops were too dry for my liking.

Salmon on rice in soup - ?
That's literally what it was to me. The broth was interesting. At the end of each bite, there was a floral scent. It was like flower-scented soup. Not bad, but just unexpected.

Service
The staff was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. It would've been nice if they had told us which dish was which without being asked.

Reservations
We had to call a few times before getting through to book a reservation. The deal said that reservations had to be made 24 hours in advance but we called in the afternoon and got a seat for 7pm. The place was pretty empty when we got there but was almost full by the time we left around 9. We assumed it would be busier later on as it was more of a late night eats place (5pm-2am).

Menu/prices
I probably wouldn't go back if I didn't have a group deal like the one we had. We ordered 8 dishes and a beer. The total was just shy of $70 so we each ended up paying around $20 (for the coupon itself and tax+tip).,1,UGW-9bbBEB3eP1o6mWD_WA

Although they are in Birkdale, they are tucked in the back as opposed to on the main drag, so you will likely only see the place if you are purposefully looking for it. Once we finally found it, we went in and stood at the front and looked around and saw just a few diners, but no staff.  After a minute or two, we were about to leave, when someone came and greeted us.  After that rough start, the service was friendly. They serve complimentary chips and salsa. I did not have any of the salsa, but it looked good. The mahi mahi fish tacos were very good, but be warned that they are spicy.  The Mexican Street Corn is awesome.  I did not care for the fried plantains, but they were prepared fine. I'd just never had plantains before and found that maybe they aren't my thing.  I'd say give this place a shot if you are a fan of trying different kinds of tacos. The prices are very reasonable, but I think they could get more business if they would advertise more and let people know, Hey, we're back here.,1,jBh_F1Sb7nkoEz_nyyiaxw

I let the Sales person know I was looking at the CT and got some background information on the car before being taken to his desk and asked about whether I wanted to finance or lease. Upon saying finance, the sales rep proceeded to break down all of the costs for leasing and why it's better. I'm just at the beginning stages of looking for cars right now! I don't care about financing vs. leasing. I need to pick a car before I do so.   

The rep finally goes to find us a car to test drive and I'm put in 2011 CT. That's right, a USED car with 80k on it. There was a brand new CT on the lot, which the rep said they had just gotten in, but apparently putting potential customers in used cars when they want to buy new is how this dealership thinks it is going to get sales.  

Fine, let's test drive this car. Half way through the test drive, the rep gets a call on his phone and says we need to be back at the dealership in 5 minutes because he has another customer waiting.  

This dealership obviously doesn't care at all about having me as a customer. Rest assured, the feeling is mutual and I will never return.,1,mfCYP8z56MdjaopG_zbbRw

We went to this location at 3am on a Saturday night and asked for half a fredo (with potatoes, rosemary and oregano)  and half a vittoria (tomatos, zucchini, red peppers). They didn't even blink, no problem, done. When we got it, it was packed with toppings, hot and delicious. Everything seemed cooked to perfection. 

Afterwards service was a bit off, I tried to buy a drink, and stood at the counter, drink in hand while the server talked on the phone... for about five minutes. Then I put the drink back in the fridge and sat down to finish my pizza. 

On the plus side, the variety of pizza they offer is nice, they have vegan and vegetarian pizza available by the slice (amongst others), and they are open super late.,4,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ

We planned to have dinner at T-Bones and stay the night.  We are locals, so this was supposed to be a nice stay-cation for us.   Upon check-in I was advised by front desk employee Yumi that no king bed rooms were available and we'd have to be happy with a room with 2 queen beds.  Even after showing her my reservation for the king bed room, Yumi advised me that my reservation was simply a preference.  She even threatened to call security on us if we continued to express our dissatisfaction at the refusal to honor our room reservation.  Instead of taking ownership of the shortcoming, Yumi chose to blame me for misunderstanding Red Rock's online reservation system, repeatedly talking down to me as if I were too obtuse to understand that even though I booked a room with a king bed for my husband's birthday, my booking was actually only a preference.  No where was this made clear when I made my reservation using Red Rock's online system.  In addition to Yumi's refusal to simply take ownership of the problem, she then threatened us with calling security due to our insistence that Red Rock honor my reservation.  I've lived in Nevada my entire life and have stayed at multiple local and strip area hotels, and have never been treated so poorly by a front desk agent.  Even after all the unpleasantries during the check in, Yumi then placed us in a room that looked directly at the parking garage.  I suppose that was her way of teaching us.  Although we went on to have a very nice dinner at T-Bones that night, Yumi's behavior toward us soured our entire experience.  We'll go back to staying at JW Marriott for our staycations from now on.,0,2zcgOl1cvOMfxX11s_QHfQ

Their menu takes an exceptionally creative look at stuff you'd expect to find in the southern states with heavy concern for those that prefer meatless. Everything from Southern-fried chicken and Tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches. They also have a fairly original selection of sauces to dip your fries in that's worth mentioning. The staff are cool, layed-back, and they actually seem to care that you're there.

But like I said, all of that can change the next time you go in. Food could come out luke warm and greasy, staff could be stuck-up and simply not care.

After 6 months of searching for the right design and tattoo shop I went to Skin Design. I was a walk in customer and the staff were welcoming, fantastic and put me at ease. I had a consultation with David Ruiz, the shops master Script Artist. I gave him my idea and we made an appointment a couple days later.  David nailed it!!!!!!!!! I couldn't be happier.
My guess is this is Robert Pho's shop and his status in the tattoo world is top notch, and I'm sure he isn't going put people on his staff who don't meet his standards. Great staff, clean, sterile studio, the lobby is plastered with awards, trophies, and endless news and magazine write ups.

Portion sizes are great for sharing with a large family. We a family size seafood soup. Should have gone with the smaller size because we ended up taking half of it home. It was really good! For our dinner we ordered a ton of dishes. Lobster, done the traditional way with green onion, Mango chicken and shrimp dish - unique flavour combo - we enjoyed it. Seafood chow mein, general Tao chicken, fried chilli turnip patties, spice and pepper salt squid, snow peas with garlic sauce -  everything was amazing. We had lots to take home for lunch the next day.

There was an egg on top, but it didn't feel like there was egg in the sauce (and thus I felt it was not creamy enough). Pizza was alright. The side dishes were good except for the rosemary fries. I thought that there could've been more rosemary flavour to it. (Note: after we finished the fries, we then realized that the seasonings were all on the bottom of the bowl the fries came with!! So, hint: toss your fries before you devour!). We also had one of the salads (the Tuscan salad?) and it was very flavourful.

We've been to Crave ever since it's opened. I've tried a handful of dishes there and for the most part, I've enjoyed my meals. I've also had pretty good service here as well. 

First time we came here, we were with a larger group, they had just opened a couple of weeks before and the manager came out to get our opinion. Nice guy who genuinely wanted to get our feedback. 

My previous visit, my husband ordered the lamb chops. They were all bone and my husband was really disappointed - it's not a cheap meal after all! So he bought it up to the waitress and she offered him a new meal.

Most recently, I had the New York strip and my husband had the filet minion. My steak was over done and was tough to eat. Gravy for my potatoes did not taste proper either. My husband shared half his portion with me - his meal was cooked perfectly.  My friends who ordered steaks and pastas were pleased with their meals, so I was the odd one out. 

Dessert was good - had the molten chocolate cake with ice cream - delish!

There is a little bit of everything from meats, pastas, seafood, salads, pizzas, breads, fruits, breakfast items (omlet station, pancakes/waffles, warm maple syrup, thick slabs of bacon, red potatoes, and sausage-SO YUMMY!!!!) and desserts!!! Champage/mimosas were optional for a small extra charge and the orange juice tasted like it was freshly squeezed. My favorites were the large cocktail shrimp, prime rib, ham, turkey, sea bass/salmon, coos coos, sushi, eggs bennidict, and the best cherry danishes that I've ever had!!!! The fresh fruit was amazingly sweet and ripe especially the strawberries, cantaloupe, and watermelon. The waitress was attentive and checked on our table often. We tried everything and I wasn't disappointed with anything. My daughter is 8 and can be a picky eater, but even she was in  pure heavan with the selections.

My favourite dish out of the 6 we ordered. The portion was bigger than I expected. A good mix of textures and flavours. Warning: peanuts.

Rare beef - $16
There were 4 slices of soft rare beef. I thought it was ok..probably wouldn't order it again.

Tartare 2 ways - $10
1) Spicy tuna with avocado on a crispy rice cake
2) Salmon with shallots on a crispy rice cake
I enjoyed the tartare and the deep fried rice added a nice crunch

Braised spiced short ribs - $22
This was my least favourite dish but it was probably because I was expecting thinly sliced short ribs (like galbi short ribs). 

Shanghainese steamed pork belly with sauteed brandy apples - $19
The pork belly was ok.  I don't like cooked apples so that didn't appeal to me. 

Our meal came with complimentary dessert (I believe every diner gets it) which was a nice surprise. 

Service

I was actually the only person in the office beside staff (2 people). Went in because I'm paranoid about bug bites. The doctor told me there was no sign of infection but as a precautionary measure gave me THREE prescriptions for preventative purposes - including antibiotics. Needless to say I won't be back.,3,6oA8D7W2x2ECcUXMtAe6MA

It's beautiful, calming, clean and modern without making me feel like I'm in a Buddhist temple. The therapists are always great and professional and the prices are average.

It also comes with a small side of kimchi which you take yourself from the fridge. Combos come with miso soup, salad and jap chae (glass noodles). The fish/pork cutlets are huge and a lot of rice accompanies it. 

This is one of my go-to spots for lunch in St. Clair Centre. It's located in the food court, lower level. Tucked away behind a Chinese fast food place.,0,UGW-9bbBEB3eP1o6mWD_WA

We were told to get as close to the person next to you as you can.. Not sure how that is relaxing when I almost got kicked in the face during downward dog! The two women at top did their best to try to make up their own yoga class, but I am almost POSITIVE it was different from what they were doing below! I don't know if someone was money hungry or what.. But they definitely OVERSOLD tickets. Would love to do it again as long as they only sold a limited amount of tickets!

However Friday 4 pm there were hardly any customers and very little noise and we enjoyed watching kids go from arcade to arcade.
I liked how you can pay flat 50 dollars you want to spend there and split it between as many people as you want. 
I am not an arcade fan by all means but I did enjoy racing my 18years old and watching  my 14 month old 'stomp the ball'.

My first time there she rather hilariously proclaimed her sandwiches would boost my libido and make me a virile sex machine.  The Banh Mi are delectable, massive, and cost $2 tax included.  TWO DOLLARS!  Where on earth do you find a deal like that in this day and age? $10 flat gets you 5 sandwiches, which will feed you for 3 days.

There are a gazillion reviews for Banh Mi Boys, with their inflated pricing and rather pretentious take on the venerable sandwich.  Their food is great, don't get me wrong - but there's no tradition, and you're feeding a hipster machine with good branding, location, and social media presence. It will also set you back $20 for one meal.  I urge you to save your money for Rose.

My boyfriend and I were going a little nuts on Groupon yesterday (I think we purchased 3 different deals) when we discovered a Groupon Now! for Thai Buffet.  My boyfriend is a huge buffet fan, and we both love Thai food.  He got really, really excited and I couldn't say no, so we purchased our final deal of the day, went and ran some errands, and finished off at Thai Buffet.

We were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.  Joann, the owner, described each of the dishes to us and piled our plates high with a variety of curries, as well as a bowl of soup and another plate of salad.  We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.  And they were.

My favorite was probably the green curry; it wasn't as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it, which I love.  Everything tasted more homemade than restaurant-y, for lack of a better descriptor.  I felt like I was in a Thai grandma's kitchen, and it was awesome.

As we finished our massive plates of food, Joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango, pumpkin custard, and sticky rice.  This might have been my favorite part of the meal, but it's hard to say because it was all so good.  I'm a total sucker for sticky rice, though.

Definitely will be back.  You get a great value for the price (even without a Groupon, the buffet is $9.99/person), with quality eats and very friendly service.,1,vbe6VKvvOHn0BkqAhhmEmw

Most recent visit, my group and I waited for an hour before the first meal was delivered. From there it took another 20 minutes before we all got our food. 

I ordered the peppercorn steak. I ordered it medium well, they gave it to me well done. It was chewy, hard and not flavourful at all.  The vegetable side was a big gloppy mess of green and red peppers - the sauce they cooked it in tasted like a glue of corn starch and water. There were three small half pieces of roasted potatoes. For 22 bucks I expect a lot more. 

Our waitress was nice - felt bad for her because it's not her fault that the kitchen is so slow, but she had to hear about it from the customers in the dining room.,0,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

The service was less than mediocre. Brianna who brought our food knocked my sons drink all over him and didn't have the courtesy to apologize. In fact she said she didn't do it when clearly she did if other customers said they saw her do it. It was obvious that there wasn't supervisor presence in the establishment. It's going to take customer service for this place to survive on the strip. You get what you pay for here. Good burgers and no customer service. This proves it is is hard to find good help!

Alas, it appears certain things have taken a dive. Our waitress started off great, bringing us water, taking our cocktail and wine order, then brought over the steak centerpiece and went over each steak. Cocktails and wine came out, our wine server was prompt in refilling our wine glasses and gracious. Our meals came out, and the steaks were cooked perfectly, but I wasn't wowed like I was the 1st time. Also, one of my friend's had an issue with his crab legs, there were 2 tendents attached, and the ends were rough. For $55, this is unacceptable, our waitress didn't come over for 15-20 mins, when she finally came over she took it off the bill, but she should have checked on us sooner to make sure our steaks were cooked properly.

I had been emailing Tom at Friendly Computers and told him exactly what was wrong with my hard drive and what Geek Squad and other techs had told me (that it would have to go to a clean room in order to recover my data).  Being desperate because all of my 2 year old's baby pictures and videos are on that hard drive, Tom gave me hope (false hope) so I took it in to him.  He told me he was 60-70% confident that he would be able to retrieve my data.  I had to pay $169 flat rate fee and leave the hard drive with them possibly for a couple of week.  About 5 days later he calls me and he tells me that he can't get any of my data.   He offers to send it to their clean room lab for an evaluation but the $169 that I already paid them was not gonna be refunded to me.  I told him I paid $169 for nothing and he said well it wasn't for nothing because we've been working on it and trying.  This sounds to be like a great way to scam people.  Tell them you think you can help them and get them to pay the $169 all the while knowing that you can't get any of that data but you sure got their money.  Wonder how many others are out there that have been thru the same situation.  Also, I have read this sales agreement/receipt 3 times and don't see where it says the fee is non refundable even if they can't retrieve your data.  Maybe I'm overlooking it but I don't see it.  DO NOT GO TO FRIENDLY COMPUTERS.  They are not friendly.  They are major con artists, scammers, liars, etc.  Don't waste your time or money and don't get your hopes up.  I got my hard drive back from him minus my $169 that was wasted down the drain and he probably erased all my data so that no one else would be able to recover it since I refused to let him send it to his lab.  I will never be able to recover those videos now of my toddlers first roll over, first crawl, first word, first steps, etc..  This is definitely not how I treat people and certainly don't want to be treated this way by others, especially businesses in my own community.  WOW!!!!,7,Inb_NNvrogAj_UHw9cd7Ag

They have a casual atmosphere, and are generally a good venue to find local food stuffs. Corner store by day, dinner establishment by (some) nights, it's really a great space.

The drop-in dinners are usually why we end up there once a week (or more) whenever they have a vegan one (which is on the regular.) It's always something different, but it has been consistently delicious. The chef stylings of Len (who I think is the owner) cooking something up every Tuesday, Emily Z, or Kalmplex (and many others) make this place just a total hidden gem (that I kind of don't want to tell anyone about, because I want to keep it to myself.)

As people have mentioned, sign up for the newsletter on their website (or connect with them on facebook/twitter) to keep up with the events they have going on, there is always something for everyone. 

The house made sodas are totally delicious (elderberry, blackcurrent, maple lemonade, just to name a few), they also have coffee/tea, apple cider, and soy milks. 

Packaged foods include local mushrooms, jams and jellies, ketchup made in house, and freshly baked buns and breads (often with gluten-free options as well), soups, milks, yogurts, and other small business produced products.

There is WiFi, there is table space, and the service is always friendly. It's like a home cooked meal in the best possible way.

When I have sold to them, I have brought in items that were brands like Calvin Klein, BCBG, Express, Limited, Gap, Forever 21, Old Navy, and bebe, but they just dig through the bag, pull out the clothes from Target, and purchase those. They reject the rest of them, claiming things like they never heard of those brands or those are older people brands. The purchasers have always been very young ladies, probably still in their teens, but I'm still surprised they are unfamiliar with these brands. If they are specifically looking to buy and sell clothing for teens, it seems they should change their marketing to reflect this, because that is not the impression I get from their online presence and store name. My suggestion to shoppers would be to just head across the parking lot and buy your  clothes directly from Target, where you'll likely pay less for them new than they are charging for them used.,0,jBh_F1Sb7nkoEz_nyyiaxw

Their dogs come from puppy mills, they were taken from their mothers far too soon and many dogs in the store have kennel cough and other illnesses due to improper care.  The staff, as expected, tell you the dogs came from reputable breeders and have papers, which means nothing and is standard in this industry.  This is where people go to purchase designer dogs for astronomic prices, without doing the research or investigating this industry.  A simple search on google will tell you all you need to know about petstores, puppy mills, and the store itself.  Go to petfinder.com and search for a rescue dog that fits your needs, or check out local animal shelters.  If you are looking for a specific hypoallergenic dog, check out breed-specific rescue organizations (ie. poodle rescue).

I've spent $6 at other places that were both stronger AND bigger. It was neither strong nor large. Great food though honestly, the steak was cooked perfectly. And the staff is very nice.

133,iVCx91Wrn-CjpxJAyLHPxg,2,2011-01-03,0,4T3tLnPK6MntQAPVItIEFg,2,Having grown up enjoying pubs far and wide, it doesn't take much to cajole me into visiting the newest local for a pint and bite to eat. This was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at Axis Gastropub on the corner of Bloor and Markham in Mirvish Village.

Axis sits in the old Rocco's Plum Tomato location and is the sister pub to Axis Gallery and Grill in the Junction. This corner seems to be one of the those 'Bermuda Triangle' hospitality locations, with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again. Maybe the Axis folks will succeed where others have not.

Arriving, a number of us remarked that the large room, decorated in a modern style, was a little stark and very empty for the time of day. It certainly didn't scream 'Pub'.

Within seconds we were greeted by the two servers/bartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever we'd like. Both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the day.

Taking a large table in the back of the room, we sat, chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appeared.

Perusing the menu, it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone. The choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with 'build your own' pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pasta.

At the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared, but again not remarkable. Combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.

Overall, Axis Gastropub does not live up to its name. It doesn't really feel like a Pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food. Maybe it is a case of higher expectations, but I can't imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby.,2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

I've visited at various times during the day and it seems run well enough, and though it seems to have a fairly large group of regulars it really doesn't bother me, but I know that that could turn some patrons off. HOWEVER, as a Chicagoian who values quality food I can honestly say that Jolies has a menu that's unrivaled in the valley. I've easily tried half a dozen dishes and everything was MUCH better than I expected. The service is always good, and it's easy to flag down a server when things get busy and they seem on top of it. So thanks, Jolie's, for being a place that's been reliably good.,1,ZAWEuVjtgC65ITpDoCrI0w

My parents had made a reservation for us (on a Wednesday night) and we were sat at a high-top bar table?  The dining area was wide open, so my mom wasn't exactly ecstatic about it. The staff can be a bit rude (stuck up).  

At our table we had basil rolls, fried wontons, red curry duck, basil chicken, volcano shrimp and the Pad Thai.  The Pad Thai was by far my favorite, we will come back simply for that dish.  We also had a pear martini which was delicious and unique.  Overall our dinner was great, but the experience not so much.,1,iLdjvT0KvcxX51falNI6hA

Rowing is an incredible total body workout that quickly improves your performance in all athletic activities.  When I finally started running again, I was surprised that I was doing better than before my injury! I would never have stuck with it and developed this appreciation if it wasn't for Morten. I can't imagine a more knowledgeable and devoted rowing coach- an opinion shared by every student I've met in his classes.
Since joining I've added spinning, boot camp and yoga to the list of classes I regularly attend. The schedule is perfect for me (early mornings, but there are evening classes as well) and I always look forward to starting my day with this group. Taking a spin or boot camp class from Linda is fun and inspiring.  She accomplishes an unbelievable amount every day, but nothing ever weakens her contagious passion for fitness.  The community of members is great too, and there are always opportunities to join others for local events like races.
As a person used to just getting up and running for my exercise, I never thought I would want or need to join a gym. But I am so happy I did. At Class Fitness I've found friendship, accountability, and new adventures!,0,13pXNVZXCLJMdTa9BcofDA

I still moved forward with the service and both my products wore off in one month.. these typically would wear off after 3 months for Botox and 12 months for juvederm. They say it's because everyone metabolizes differently... but experts would say this is due to dilution. Groupon prices are amazing but not so much so considering the potential dilution and the fact that they are using free products without telling us.

All I can say is if you are even remotely interested, you need to go.  The energy & comedy that goes into the shows are fantastic.  You will not be disappointed.

A great place to go as a couple, couple of friends, birthday party or stagette.  If you're a larger group, it may take a few months to book in so make sure to call.

Tickets are around $60 for the show & do not include dinner & drinks.  That said, the drinks must be kind of part of that because a 1 litre of Newcastle beer was only $6 :D  So they encourage you to go and get plastered...alllll right :)

As well, the restaurant will be changing to Salt & Peppers mexican very soon, so the food is about to get a whole lot better.  I have never had the food here because it is sooooo not about that.  It's about having drinks with friends and watching the Angels!   A lot of audience participation too.

One more note...this show, somehow is really funny for people of all ages (18+ due to the comedy content).  Very very funny.  GO!,2,LIV6TiZSTWnRJKBZGnZuRQ

We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June. The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60. For Scottsdale, this is a steal! We shared an appetizer and a main entree. The appetizer was delish. Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus. Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter. For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach. Fantastic. The service was also great.

Upon reading all the reviews on yelp and how great sweet republic was, my family and I decided to try it. The Toffee Bonafi was a party in my mouth, literally! The combination of vanilla, toffee brittle, and salted caramel was a great way to end my night. My daughter got the strawberry sherbet and the taste was bursting with strawberry flavor. You can tell that it was made from scratch and no where near compares to any store bought strawberry ice cream.

Then on the scheduled pick-up time, post event, they were also late.  I waited at home for 3 hours for the scheduled pick-up.  30 minutes post time block, I called and asked their status, or to reschedule.  The gentleman on the other end told me that now they needed to charge me extra money for a specific time pick-up.  I replied, I don't need a specific time, I just was hoping that you would meet the schedule you had asked for on the equipment pick-up.  I advised that the heaters were on the patio where the delivery technician had placed them the day prior.   The gentleman at A to Z said that again they needed to charge me more money as a set-up charge to get them off my patio, where they had placed them originally.  He told me that they needed to be curb side.  So, I alone, had to carry them up a steep driveway, and they were quite heavy.  It was a struggle and massive to handle.  The customer service individuals at A to Z were rude to me and non-helpful.  All they wanted to do is stick me with charges above and beyond already set contract.

The meat was too tough to eat out of the sandwich, could only be eaten with a knife and fork after a lot of chewing, the sandwich bread was burnt to a crisp... definitely not a $16 sandwich.

128,Uw-kIS3HTuAohfg0edQZ3Q,2,2010-12-08,0,ZXfIARFQ5sKpO0IEdc9qlw,3,Joy Bistro is a beautiful, sophisticated resto just inside Leslieville on Toronto's East side. It's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage. It's become somewhat of a Leslieville landmark.

First things first, I've heard a lot of negative comments about this place. By the sounds of it, it's one of those places that's hit-or-miss and completely different from one visit to the next; amazing one time, awful the next. Because I've never had dinner there, I can't vouch for evening dining, but I can say this: if you truly don't want run the risk of being disappointed, stick with their weekend brunch. This place is known for brunch. While they may have their issues, Joy Bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of style.

Brunch at Joy Bistro is not really bistro-ish. The brunch food here is mostly just what you'd expect to see on a brunch menu in most Toronto restaurants, but they do their brunch stuff particularly well. Eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like Benetine (with spinach and peameal bacon), Norwegien (with stacked smoked salmon), and Teddy (with peameal bacon, roasted tomatoes, and spinach). With their near-perfect hollandaise, eggs benny at Joy Bistro is a solid choice.

That, and they've got a killer patio. Intimate and relaxing, their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences. Leslieville has got a few patio spots, but for sheer space, warmth, and location sitting on a busy little Leslieville corner overlooking Jimmie Simpson Park, Joy Bistro's patio is in a league of its own. Worth the sit down in the summer.

They've recently undergone mass renos, which has resulted in Joy Bistro Bar. Although this may have helped the space modernize, it's also contributed to changing their clientele base. Neighbourhood locals that frequented Joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over. I guess as Leslieville becomes more popular, Joy Bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood, and while change can be good, in most cases, if it isn't broke them why fix it?

Despite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch. So the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to Joy Bistro for brunch on the patio. By the sounds of it though, I certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch.,2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

Wie mir Einheimische erzählten war das Ziel, ein ganzes Mittagessen komplett zwischen zwei Scheiben Toast unterzubringen. 
Das ist ja schon sehr praktisch, wenn man Steak, Salat und Fritten direkt auf einmal in sich reinschieben kann und es einem nichts ausmacht, wenn man von einem Ohr bis zum anderen mit dem halben Belag dekoriert ist.
Ich hab mich dann für die Variante 'Tuna' (6.50$) entschieden, was sich allerdings nicht gerade als sinnvoll erwiesen hat. Vielleicht wars der Jetlag oder das leckere Sam Adams, bei Tuna hatte ich an ein Thunfisch gedacht. Nun ja, es war eher eine Thunfischpaste oder sowas, mit Krautsalat, Fritten, Gurken und was weiß ich nicht alles.
Hat eigentlich nur noch die Apfeltorte obendrauf gefehlt.
OK, es war ein sehr lustiger Abend. Das junge Personal hatte auch seinen Spass, als wir das ganze auf Bildern festgehalten hatten.
Restaurant würde ich es nicht nennen. Mit der ganzen Baseball/Basketball Dekoration und den zahllosen TVs an den Wänden, Spielautomatem (und passenderweise gleich dem Geldautomaten daneben) läuft es bei mir eher unter Schnellimbiss.
Auch war man mit der Tischreservierung für 12 Personen schon etwas überfordert.
Es gibt auch eine reichhaltige Auswahl an Vorpseisen (4-5$; gefüllte Jalepenos, Nachos, Hühnchenstreifen, Champignons, ..., natürlich alles schön frittiert). Die Preise sind für diese Art Schnellimbiss durchaus OK.,0,E1tdgFl62lhL9QseMbTHPQ

They want to play patty cake and pretend it is negotiations.  It is plastered all over their wall, (literally) painted that they respect their customers.  I guess if you see and read something everyday you actually believe you are demonstrating those values.  SOOO NOT TRUE!  Find another dealership where they respect the intelligence of women and others.

Oh yeah,  they tried to keep us at the dealership, by pretending that we had taken the keys to the test drive vehicle.............HILARIOUS!

Their menu features a wide variety of dishes - mostly typical Korean fare. However, people usually go for their cold noodles. They also feature an extensive list of Sundae (soon-deh) dishes, which is Korean sausage made with pig organs and intestines. Observing the other tables, I noted that it wasn't as popular as Naeng Myeon. However, keep in mind that it was a hot summer evening and the cold noodles are just that good. I personally like Sundae (spelling it like that is making me want ice cream...argh. I better switch to Soondae), and encourage you to try it!

Chik Bibim Naeng Myeon (Thin arrowroot noodles with a special sauce)
Win!
This was perfect for the hot day. The slushy broth, cooling veggies, chilled arrowroot noodles, and sliced hard-boiled egg made this the most satisfying bowl of noodles that I've had in Toronto. I chowed until all that was left was a puddle of the special spicy sauce which I loved. From what I observed, it's essentially hot pepper paste (gochu-jang), hot pepper flakes, and probably a bit of soy & minced garlic.
The slurried broth kept the dish chilled while I ate through my mother's plate of Tang Soo Yuk. My father and I shared dumplings & short ribs.
Anyways, I can quite honestly say that this was the best bowl of cold noodles that I've had to date, rivalling South Korea. While it may seem backwards to eat spicy food when it's hot, it was super satisfying and it didn't make me feel hotter at all.
Not a fan of spicy food? They offer Mul Naeng Myeon, which is essentially the same thing but without the spicy sauce (but that's what makes this so good, so please...get the bibim!!). It comes with seasonal fruit - watermelon was being served tonight. I like watermelon, but I love spice.
I also like squirting hot mustard all over my noodles. You can also add vinegar, but I don't like it in my Naeng Myeon.

Tang Soo Yuk (Korean-style Chinese dish. Sweet & Sour Pork)
Soggy :(
A childhood favourite of mine, this is an example of Korean-style Chinese cuisine. There are many dishes that you'll find in Korean restaurant under this niche - Jajamyeon (black bean noodles) is another popular example. Sticky-sweet, when it's done right the deep-fried pork, chicken, or beef has super crispy batter and is tender on the inside with a generous helping of sugary syrup, vegetables and fruit. Unfortunately, this was not done right. It was squishy, not crispy, which pretty much ruined the dish. Boo.

Kalbi (Grilled, marinated beef short ribs)
Skip this...
I've had better - much better. I am a bit of snob since I often make my own short ribs, but since I don't have a grill I like ordering them from restaurants. The cut of meat tasted low grade and fatty, and the flavour was lacking from the missing green onions. Moving on.

Mandu (dumplings Available fried or steamed)
Deep fried goodness!
Another dish that I often make on my own, I still like to order these in restaurants since I never deep-fry them at home. I was pleased with these, and I would order them again with my noodles over the kalbi any day!

I was a little frustrated with the service, but it was super-busy so I wasn't upset. The servers were rushing between tables, so they definitely weren't slacking. I was simply anxious to get my banchan because I was super hungry and jealously watching other tables get theirs while we were a little forgotten...even though we were right in front of the kitchen. Oddly, we received our mandu (dumplings) and kalbi (short ribs) before our banchan but again, they were under quite a bit of pressure so I didn't complain. We were also not given a box of cutlery, and it was hard to wave a server down. Needing something to eat the food on our table, I leaned over and swiped a box from another table.

So if you are looking for home-cooked Jamaican style dishes, it's worth checking out. The owner is lovely, she is super sweet and charming.

We went many of the suggested dishes on Yelp - - started with the Chicken Pakoras. Okay. These were amazing. Not a ton of breading - just right. And the flavours were soooo yum! I could eat this all by themselves all day! I've had many versions of Chicken Pakoras and this is hands down the best one. We also went the Crispy Beef as everyone seems to suggest. It was good! Gingery, sesamey and nicely done with some onions. Wouldn't be Hakka dinner if we didn't try their Chilli Chicken with gravy which was also good! Could have been a touch spicier but it was good nonetheless.  We had the Hakka noodles which was also good. The shrimps were a bit small - but there was too much going on with other ingredients to miss them too much.

The counter rep was friendly and helpful,  and we were welcomed with a courteous greeting and bottles of cold water when we went downstairs to pick up our car.  Another rep showed us several cars  to choose from and answered our questions with patience and professionalism.  Returning the car was just as easy.

I removed one star because the rep made a point of emphasizing that Arizona is a no-fault state and we'd be liable for lost use of the car if it landed in the shop, regardless of whether the other driver was at fault.  With over $200 in added insurance and a $10 a day upgrade, our original weekly rental of $197 burgeoned into well over $525.  

I don't blame Enterprise - we should have researched our liability in advance.  But they do prey upon travelers' anxiety when they're eager to hit the road and start their vacations.  It's a scam.,7,742Gsec3pKTQ7z0BYI_DrQ

I like the atmosphere, especially now that they've expanded (before I remember this place being pretty cramped). It is a bit loud when it's packed but it's nice, bright, and airy. 

The coffee is also delicious and it's one of the few places where you can find a real flat white, just like what you would get in New Zealand. 

The food is too over the top for me. I'd prefer some more simplistic stuff on the menu. If I recall correctly, they used to have a grilled cheese on the menu that was really good but now it seems to only be on the kids menu. 

I'd re-visit this place for a coffee some time but don't know if I'd come back to eat anything.,1,mfCYP8z56MdjaopG_zbbRw

Congratulations Joe Badali's. You suck. 

Original Review: Having been here a few years ago, I remember thinking it was mediocre and hadn't been back until this week, where I was reminded how mediocre it is. 

I was here for lunch, where this restaurant has a fixed price menu (outside of Summer/Winterlicious). I tried this and had a Cesar salad which had nice and creamy dressing, the pappardelle alfredo which was pretty bland, and then a scoop of gelato. The gelato was vanilla and pretty good, however I wasn't allowed to choose what flavour I wanted. Is vanilla the only flavour they have? Overall, a pretty blase meal. 

Service was ok, nothing special. I like the design of this restaurant though, it's pretty cool, if you don't mind the subway rumbling below your feet every few minutes.,1,mfCYP8z56MdjaopG_zbbRw

It was busy 4 of the 5 times we went (Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening visits). If you have a group, make reservations because otherwise you'll be packed into a corner sharing a table with 2 or 3 people. 

Waffles and crepes were really good. I had a waffle topped with fruit and a scoop of their vanilla ice cream (which I heard was made in house, not commercial brand). Very good! My friend has the crepe with chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce - also very good!

Another occasion we had the hot chocolate with a slice of chocolate cake. Hot chocolate was really good. The cake slice was huge. I feel that they could reduce the price (which was pricy as is!) and serve a smaller portion. This is definitely a share sized piece of cake - but you're stuck with just one variety if you're with a date. Table beside us had a group of 3 who ordered 3 slices and left about half of their cake behind. 

They sometimes have entertainment - Bollywood dancers, band, themed parties, which is a nice change from the normal dessert places.,0,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

They provided good service for a number of purchases my family made, but it seems things have changed recently. After receiving a ring for Christmas I took it in to be resized and was warned by the lady that I should keep a little extra room as your fingers may measure small in the winter. I had to pay to have the ring resized even when though it was a gift from their store, which seems like a service they should offer along with the purchase. When I got it back it did still seem too large and could spin around my finger, but they gave the same guidance. I waited a few months for the weather to warm up and the ring is still too large. When I returned to the store, they wanted to charge me another resizing fee to 'fix' it, even though it was upon their guidance that I accepted the 'roomier' fit in the first place. I'm really disappointed in their service and the general manner in which they now seem to be doing business. They've lost me and my family as clientelle.,7,tS-5qhPTfoDx9azVYrmUeQ

Every one of the people I came in contact with were 4 or 5 star people except one.  He was my night nurse and his name is Dave.  I was on the 6th floor, room #7 of Saint Joseph's Hospital.  The nurse shift change is at 7:30 pm so there was a meeting of Nurse leaving, me and nurse coming on duty ... that would be Dave.  We went over all my meds and that I was also due pain medication at 8 pm (now 7:40).  It was also discussed that my Doctor ordered an IV fed antibiotic also to drip during the night.  I called for Dave at 8:30 and asked about my medication which were due at 8 pm.  He said he was busy but would get to me soon.  At 9 pm I called Dave again who informed me that I would not be getting the pain medication because I had not specifically requested it at 8 pm. He also informed me that he decided not to do the  antibiotic drip.  I told him that I wanted both medications or I would unhook myself and go to a different hospital.  I told him I didn't feel safe with him and that I would be submitting a formal complaint in the morning.  That seemed to change his attitude and He finally agreed and gave me the meds sometime after 10 pm.  Dave avoided me most of the rest of the night.  Next morning I asked to speak with Dave's supervisor.  Someone came in who didn't really seem concerned (like this happens all the time).  While she was there my doctor came in for a routine checkup on my condition.  I told him what happened the night before and he immediately asked for the floor manager to come down and speak with me and take a report.  The Manager said she would be right down.  This was at 6:30 am and in spite of my reminders, the floor manager never did show up or contact me.  I think Dave is dangerous.  I stayed awake all that night because I was afraid of what he might do.  Dave needs to be identified and prevented from being around sick people.,4,nazlxDutX5FcG3F6xnFF-Q

+ Pick up orders / delivery.  I personally always took a break from work to stop in, but you can call ahead and pick up, or have them deliver!

-/+ Small dining area.  This is mostly made to cater to the HUGE amount of local business there, so I'm not surprised they only have a handful of table and chairs.  Still a nice place to stop for lunch if you need a break. :)

The Marketplace was...well, we thought it was like a hospital cafeteria with a lot less staff and a giant mess. Popcorn all over the floors and counters, condiments spilled, condiment droppings on the counter. Saw 2 girls with brooms - not cleaning but chatting it up with the cashier.

Gotta line up 3 times, one to order, another to pay, and another to pick up your order. Pure confusion for a 1st timer. So you go back, front, and back. Liked the soda machine cause you pick and mix. The 'bar?' It looks like  and afterthought with I think 5 stools.

The bathroom. GROSS. 4 stalls not completely flushed and 1 with wet droppings on the floor. 2 sinks without soap and the used papertowels were overflowing. The automatic machine was rolling the new ones into the used ones. Did I mention there was red/brown debris on the stainless steel? 

Ok recliners but I doubt anyone actually measured the distance from the screen to the seats because we were on 2nd to last row and it still felt too close. We got a headache.,4,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ

Providence Pediatrics has moved since we started going to them, but our loyalty to Dr. Plonk is unwavering and I drive past several other pediatrics offices to get there (which, admit idly is a pain)... but, his kind bedside manner and his trust in a mother's intuition, with his own dose of intuition has worked wonderfully for our family of three daughters.

He has called to check in on a very sick child, offering to work with our health care provider for in-home nursing care if we got too overwhelmed-- this all on a Saturday.  He called every day for a week to check on her (and us).  He has reassured a desperate mother that her unruly child was just spirited and strong willed.  

His father was a country doctor and Dr. Plonk has that same genuine care and concern that I imagine (and have heard) that his father had.  

Unfortunately, we have had some medical bumps along the way and Dr. Plonk has helped us navigate through these tough times.

The service department is just as bad. They tell you that they have fixed/repaired the parts, but when you get it home, nothing works properly. They also keep your trailer for weeks at a time, so if you plan on using it, good luck getting it back on time for your next trip.

From the moment I saw the familiar Live sign appear in Liberty Village, I've been waiting. They opened in the week I was out of town visiting family, so for a week, I watched from a far, watching my friends post pictures of the various things they had bought, and ate,  looking forward to being back in my hood of Liberty/Niagara so I too could eat this stuff too.

Live Market is conveniently(?) located right near my gym, so I have been here three times in a fairly short time period, and it's nice to have such a great post-workout option, and really extra nice to have a close non-starbucks coffee/tea option near my house.

Both times I've actually ordered food, it's been very very tasty. First time - the chickpea burger, second time, upon the recommendation of the server - Burdock Burrito (Do order this. It is yummy.) Live Market also keeps me in Silk Road earl grey tea. I've had the wherewithal to arrive shortly before the influx of Liberty Village work folks coming in on their lunch break.

I often feel like the best way to tell the service level of a restaurant is how they handle minor errors. My partner ordered and ended up waiting a fairly long time for his lunch order, so not only did they make it right, they apologized, and offered him a coffee for his trouble. Smooth. Empowered staff make me a happy camper, so we just left liking them even more.

They've got Ezra Pound roasted coffee, and prepared ready-to-go items, juices, snacks, and treats, as well as order-in items if you have a little more time. 

There are lots of locally made products like ChocoSol chocolate, Stasis Preserves, Bunner's Cookies, Sweets from the Earth treats, amongst other things. You can buy protein powder, tea, coffee, and even make up. They also have jars of Rawtella for sale, which I wouldn't call healthy, but I would call really really delicious (since I did end up buying some on my last visit...)

Service has been consistently friendly, food has been consistently good, and I feel like I get good value for my money when I go there.

Things to know: They don't have debit/credit working yet, but it's coming soon. I.E., At the moment it's Cash Only.,2,YgavGxfAdjhkkbwlAY_9ZQ

My ski jackets and paint for lost and his dealing with the problem was perfect. He was professional and prompt and always keep me in the loop.  Never did I think he would screw me and he just stood up and did the right thing.  Refreshing to see someone makes a problem go away instead of get bigger.  By making the fix to the problem right he showed me that this is a good company to deal with. The norm would not have done me right and I'd still have a problem or I'd have to compromise on some way.

Let me say first that as a tea freak I love that this place exists, and now I can go to either the Biltmore or Scottsdale Fashion Square location. But here's what happened to me, and I repeat it here as a warning: I walked by the store with no intention of going in. Thirsty, I sampled a tea by the door, then another tea. Then I thought, what the heck -- I walked a few feet into the store and sampled another tea. That's when a lady of Teavana snagged me, chatting quite knowledgeably about the tea I was tasting and inviting me, like a Siren, to get a whiff from a tea canister at the counter. Expertly, she fanned the lid of the canister over the leaves so that I could get the full effect. Oh my, that orange-pomegranate-whatever smelled good. Must I take some home? Oh yes, I must. That lovely 8-ounce canister of herbal tea will be $36, please. Yikes!,3,0wvlpzuR4mnZfMcoG8N31Q

Unfortunately, they haven't had these again on any of my visits since and none of the other cupcakes I've tried have been as good, although most have been tasty.  The service is always okay--not rude but also not especially friendly.  I think if they would try to be a little more personable they could drum up more business, because they have a good product and good business idea.  I actually liked their old location better, but I can see why they moved, because the old one wasn't very visible.  I think more parents and little ones would come to the new location if they would make it easier to enter with a stroller.  Overall, they have a better space than their close competitor and a comparable product, but I think the reason their nearby competitor is always busier is because of the friendlier service.  Just Baked is definitely worth a try and I hope they stick around and keep coming up with great cupcakes.,0,jBh_F1Sb7nkoEz_nyyiaxw

2780,gjQ20S96ScTc7LR_DY8SQQ,0,2015-08-25,0,wH2ue8uMSpCFC5N_vPv5VA,1,We had used Nyah's a couple of times to groom our 3 little dogs.  My initial impression was great because they seemed to be so kind and caring towards our kiddos.  However, from a business perspective they are terrible.  They are very difficult to get a hold of, whether if it's to make an appointment or ask a question.  We had an appointment and when I called earlier in the week to confirm the time, I did not get a response.  The morning of the appointment I reached out again to ask how much time they'd need for our dogs because we had a potential conflict and had to leave the house 3 hours out from what I was guessing was our scheduled time.  I thought maybe we could do 2 of 3 dogs, but wasn't sure if we could get all 3 done.   When I did get a response back, it was a text saying they were cancelling our appointment entirely.  No call to answer my initial question of how long they'd need or a discussion to figure out an alternative solution (I could have easily had my mother come to the house).  Then Mitch went on to say that they might not be the best service for us because they prefer customers that have recurring appointments and they were raising prices.  A...they never discussed a desire to have recurring appointments, which we'd be happy to do if we were aware it's a requirement and B...there had been no discussion about a change in pricing.  Instead they cancelled on us within hours of our appointment and implied I was lucky they weren't going to charge me a cancellation fee.  Then I find out they decided to groom other dogs that were in the neighboring house they were at that morning. This was ridiculous.  Clearly it was more convenient for them to take this other client and cancel on us, but this is poor business.  It has taken us weeks to get scheduled with another mobile groomer to take care of our dogs (which I have found to be much more professional).  I would not recommend this service due to poor communication and business practices.,3,p6Zky5fJY6_tE716jchW_Q

2839,3Zgo3Fi1DayoSkm89NweKA,1,2010-09-16,0,vfZBD6pHfdGg6A_9FsFT5A,4,As a chocolate addict, I was intrigued by the chocolate-banana-jalapeño juice. Also ordered were the honeydew-avocado-banana and a lemonade made with crushed mint leaves and sugar cane. ($4)

I liked them all - the lemonade was the most refreshing for the hot day, but I enjoyed the banana-chocolate- jalpeno flavour the most. With a consistency that's more shake-y than juice-y (makes sense given the ingredients), I enjoyed a jalapeño bite after each chocolately slurp. I wish they used a darker chocolate instead though - I think that the stronger cacao taste would go really well with the jalapeño.

The honeydew-avocado-banana was light, sweet and also on the thicker side. Next time, I think I will ask for some ice cubes in my drink even though it will dilute it a bit more just to keep it cold.

The Squirrel ($10)
Peanut butter, sardines, hot chili sauce, cucumber, sprouts and white cheddar on dark rye
How could I not order this? The combination of salty, buttery, cheesy, and spicy was pretty darn good. I just wish there was more! At $10 though, it's not bad considering the big bowl of soup that came with it.

I'd love to try this with a few slices of tomato and avocado. My friend disagrees saying that it's just make it too soggy but I think it'd be great. I think I will request that addition next time, if possible. I like tomatoes on everything though...

The Beach ($10)
Chick pea salad, roasted coconut, yakinori, sesame, sprouts, and cheddar on dark rye
Not bad, a decent healthy sandwich. The chickpeas were chickpeas, the sprouts were sprouts - I got exactly what I ordered. While tasty, I won't be craving it anytime soon and I'd sooner try something else off of their menu.

The Fish Fry ($14)
Golden fried Ontario Rainbow Trout, with a dandelion & avocado mixed green salad, white vinaigrette.
The Rainbow Trout was well done, although I wish there was more to the salad. I wonder how much it would have cost to upgrade to the Greens with Envy salad? Purple kale, dandelion, cucumber, green onion, sprouts, and broccoli sounds pretty darn good.

The following two items come with sandwiches, or you can order them separately.
Soupe de Soleil ($4)
The butternut squash and was thick, filling, and satisfying. I actually like my squash soups a bit chunky so I was quite happy with this homey bowl. There was also a bit of tomato & scallions and possibly carrot, if I recall correctly. Yum.

Black Beans ($6)
The black bean dip with avocado was also tasty with the red tortilla chips. Dense and chunky, the bowl was spooned clean. I wished there were a few more large chips in the pile, but no biggie - I just scooped some dip with my spoon with the little chip bits. In hindsight, I think I would've liked this in the sandwich too!

Julies' Pies!
Ooh...pie. With Wanda's Pie in the Sky down the street I was surprised to see Julies' Pie for dessert. I racked my poor memory for a bakery named Julie's and drawing a blank, I asked where/who Julie('s) is. It turns out that one of the owner's (Ryan) cousin's wife bakes yummy desserts for their cafe. Talk about family love :) It was a sweltering hot day, but he convinced me that the pie was reaaaalllly good with a knowing omg look on his face. Not that my sweet tooth ever needs much convincing anyways.

And reaaaallly good it was! Totally catering to my not-so-secret love affair with Ontario peaches, the filling was just the right amount of sweet and the crust (which I think is just as important!) was nice and soft. While my friend said he would've preferred more of a bite for both the peaches and the crust, I was quite satisfied as I liked the super-soft pieces of fruit. Mmmm. It wasn't syrupy or overloaded with sugar. This pie-lover was satisfied.

The service from co-owner Chris was very friendly and conversational. I heard they were going to offer fish tacos at yesterday's Pedestrian Sundays however a combination of a precarious weather forecast and something about the cousin who was going to cook 'em up made it a no-go. I must have looked crest-fallen as I got a consoling tap on the shoulder from Ryan (is it creepy that I'm using their first names as if I know them?) and a promise of their appearance on August 29th's Pedestrian Sunday. Sadly I will be out of town, but as a fanatic of Little Italy's Fish Store, at least I know where to get my fish-fix. Pout.

Overall, I had a good time at The Bellevue. While there were some things that I would like to tweak, everything tasted good and homey. The items are things that I could easily make at home, but the creative combinations certainly stirred my imagination. It won't be long before I start making my own Sardine-Nut Butter-Rye sandwiches...which may or may not be pleasant for The Bellevue to hear!,1,WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA

Some notes: 
-We ordered the cheaper steaks on the menu, and they were AMAZING. Melt in your mouth. Hard to imagine how good the Waygu and other pricey ones would be. But don't feel like you'll be shortchanged by ordering the cheaper ones. 
-Don't skip salads. The fava bean salad was the best thing I ate. Who knew a salad could be so good. 
-Sit at the bar before dinner if you have time. Our reservation was running a bit late, so we had a drink. The bartenders make the most delicious, strong drinks.

For three days, I was online looking at car dealers from all over Phoenix.  I came across one at Chapman BMW and left a message for JEFF ORENSTEIN.  He returned my call within twenty minutes, apologizing for having taken so long to call me back.  I told him I was interested in the Explorer.  He gave me the best price over the phone, which was much less than the other dealers had listed (including Craigslist), without having to haggle.  When I called him back after talking with my husband, Jeff had already inspected the vehicle, identified items he was going to get fixed before we came in to sign the paperwork.  We made an appointment for after work the next day and within an hour and a half, we were driving away.  I wish buying a TV was this easy!!,0,QkO16gr4QaPaKPWeUTAEqA

Played the Desert and Canyon courses which were both in very good shape. Cool layouts with some challenges including some tight holes. Overall though this is a very beautiful course on SE side of Camelback Mountain. 

Only criticism is that we got out early on the Desert course and played pretty quickly only to get stuck behind a whole bunch of groups at the turn going to the Canyon course. The ranger/time starter guys couldn't exactly explain why that happened.

Overall though this is a great course with nice amenities. Grass tees. GPS in cart. Would definitely come play again.,2,IKChsSm17dLG0mTHjFiDLg

The portions are huge, so a $6-$7 order of fried rice can last me up to four meals, which is an awesome [if not exactly healthy] deal.

I had read the previous YELP reviews and was a bit apprehensive when I was setting the appointments.  Suzanne answered the phone and was really personable.  She was just like the review had said, a positive in the experience.  She was able to set us appointments right away that worked for our schedule.
The following day we went to the location and were greeted by a gentleman and instructed how to fill out paperwork.  We had plenty of time to look over frames and although the selection wasn't my particular taste, there were plenty of current styles  to choose from.  The eye exam went off without a hitch, the dr was friendly and efficient and it was done quickly.  After the exam we were given more time to look at frames and Suzanne made suggestions.

I decided to look up Laotion resto's in Montreal..I wasn't expecting anything buuut BAM! I found one :) It's not close to where I live but I decided to metro up to Cote Vertu and to my surprise the food is really authentic :) 

I've had the papaya salad, chicken wings, tom yum soup, pho, lab and Laos Sausages. I love it all. I'm ecstatic there's a place that has some of my favourite dishes that no other restaurant in the city has. I go at least  once every couple weeks when I get cravings for a home cooked meal. 
Beware, if you asked for the papaya salad spicy..you'll get it spicy! I like the way they use crab paste in there too to give it that extra fishy taste the way I like it. (Most Lao people eat it like this)
The atmosphere is pretty simple and easy, prices are decent. I like hearing the women cooking and and talking in the kitchen, makes me miss talking Lao to my family. Things are fresh and made to order so if you're in a rush it's not the place to go to.,6,CYB6sZzsCM9Y70RHrFUAmQ

No complaints as far as the food goes either. By the Way has a decent sized menu with enough on it to keep most people satisfied. Despite being busy, our food arrived hot and was cooked perfectly: softly-poached eggs for the bennys, light and golden fried crust on the calamari. Where By the Way loses some points is with the service. It seemed to take forever between times the server came to our table. So overall we waited quite awhile to get, well, everything, but the quality of the food made up for most of those waiting times.

Let me be perfectly clear that it is in the Four Queens Hotel, a dive hotel on the old strip with the parking lot to match.  That said, when you step down the stairs into Hugo's Cellar you are in an entirely different environment.  Ladie's are greeted with a rose and the setting is very romantic (dark wood walls, candlelight).  Service is excellent and they have some great sommeliers.  They have a very good wine list and serve complementary bottled water, as well as a nice bread basket with cheese-toasted lavash and rose-shaped butter.  Their salads are the highlite, included with your meal and freshly prepared on a cart at your table.  Toppings like hearts of palm and bay shrimp and delicious dressings- try the orange walnut vinaigrette.  You are served an intermezzo sorbet to cleanse the palatte (raspberry on a mini cone).  Dinner is very traditional- chicken, fish, and steaks served with a potato and vegetable.  Not especially gourmet or cutting edge, but very old school classic and part of the experience.  They offer traditional desserts such as bananas foster prepared tableside, and they bring a complementary dessert of chocolate covered strawberries, dried figs, and apricots served with whipped cream.  This restaurant is great and remeniscent of old Vegas, definitely a must try.,1,dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg

I had sampled some of their very delicious appetizers at the Vegetarian Food Fair last month, so I was excited to try an entree. Well... I had the Soy Fritters with Curry Rice, and I don't know if it was just the wrong dish to order or what, but I didn't think it was very good. Fried tofu gluten fritters with carrots, potatoes, beans and cauliflower sounded so yummy but it wasn't.

The only thing I really enjoyed the flavour of was the potatoes, because they seemed to have taken on the most of the curry flavour, the veggies and soy/gluten stuff weren't very flavourful. I needed some hot sauce for sure.

At least it was on the Special Order menu so it was only 5.99, some of the other items were 10-13.

Came with a group of friends for winterlicous. Their heating wasn't working so we had to step over their space heaters to get to our table. It was pretty full considering it was a weekday evening. 

Server was very nice - she was attentive and patient. They had run out of a few things on their menu because she said they were very busy from the weekend so we had to make second choices.  They ran out of 2 appetizers, 1 main and 1 dessert so she had to stand there as we all re-read the menu to choose other things.

I had the shrimp app. Very good - big pieces. Salad could have used a bit more dressing. Butter chicken main was amazing. Tender chicken - I can't remember the last time I had such tender chicken at an Indian restaurant. The sauce was delicious - cleaned my plate with naan, which was freshly baked and soft. Rice pudding for dessert with gulab jamun. They put the gulab jamun into the rice pudding. I didn't like that, should have put it on the side.

My friends had the lamb, beef and mutton. All were raving about their food too. Did not disappoint!

Do yourself a favor and drive down to Asia Buffet. A few dollars more and it will be worth your time and money. There are also some very seedy characters in the resto. Bad, cheap food attracts the bad customers? lol,0,qr9hmaIxq1z9ycgT28PpRw

Personally I prefer contemporary Mexican cuisine with good premium margaritas (not that Jose Cuervo/Sauza stuff).

Unfortunately, the food and service at Casa De Mateo were unremarkable as was the margarita.  

I don't know if we have much choice locally (would love to hear any suggestions), but I still think you need to head down south below the 49th parallel to find really good margaritas and Mexican food.,1,h2zLiqDXdA_sOdPFRGmM5w

Make resos if you're coming for lunch on Fridays. The kitchen is really small so it does take a while for food to come out of you're with a large group.

I always get the Lola bento box - you get a choice of main dish (chicken, salmon, beef, various sushi, etc) with your Japanese bento box staples (few rolls, salad, rice, miso, tempura, fruit). Dynamite roll is really good too - pretty big serving - enough for a nice lunch!,0,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ
680,d3Wz6ENnjMHtRUXfg8idaw,0,2012-03-09,0,O_ghHY7m-_y_R2QTdNFLaQ,1,Wow... talk about the absolute WORST company I've ever tried to do business with.  It does NOT get much worse than these guys.  First... a little background, I have never gone out of my way to complain about a company.  If you see my other reviews, you'll notice I go out of my way to rave about companies on here.  There's only 1 other negative review in my portfolio, and even that company is 4 stars compared to crappy old Appliance Certified.  

I used these guys about a year ago, and the guy that came over was cool and the price was reasonable.  So I actually referred them to about 3 people since and kept their magnet on my fridge. 

However, last week my sink started leaking and we were unable to use it anymore until fixed.  I called this company right away (Thursday) to book appt for the next day (Friday).  No call... no show.  I called back later in the day simply to leave a voicemail.  Saturday I called back and they said they'd have someone out Monday (after apologizing).  Monday came... no call... no show.  Typically, I know you should give up on a poor company like this.  But, I decided to give them one more chance.  Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.  Whew... then... didn't show.  1pm I called them and a woman said she'd get on the phone with dispatcher and call me back right away with an ETA.  3 hours later... no call... no show.  I called now twice only to leave another message. 

Bottom line:  This company shouldn't even be called a company.  The suck.  My 5 year old son is more responsible and considerate. If I had nothing else to do today, I would create 3 more Yelp accounts just so I can complain 3 more times.  One for every time they messed up.,7,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ

Out of our party of four, two of us ordered mediocre dishes -- the vegetarian chile relleno and the chicken mole casserole. But the two other dishes were fine -- spinach and mango salad and chicken enchiladas suiza. The chunky salsa was also quite good, especially for those of us who've deprived ourselves of tomatoes recently. Let this be a lesson to you (and me): read reviews on Yelp for recommendations on a new restaurant's best dishes before you go. Also, a note to our server: when a customer says his dish is just OK, then DOH! -- follow up by asking how it could be better. This is especially necessary at a new place.,2,0wvlpzuR4mnZfMcoG8N31Q

I had the tandoori chicken wings as my app - didn't enjoy it all too much - it wasn't the traditional red, BBQ charred colour or taste I expected. Instead it was yellowish and looked to be semi broiled. Wasn't a fan. 

My main dish of shrimp masala was good - really enjoyed the gravy - perfect level of spice and it was really aromatic. The naan was nice and fluffy. 

For dessert I had the gulab jamun. The meal came with one, I could have easily had another 2 - these were rich, sweet and warm (I like them served warm, not cold like some restaurants do). 

Price was great and service was good as well. Will come again and try other dishes, and I know not to order their tandoori wings.,0,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

Parking is confusing and signs point you in general direction but stop short of guiding into the connected garage. I ended up parking in their overflow lot and walking half a mile through a winding set of corridors, elevator trips and turns to get to the front desk. It probably took me 20 minutes from car to front desk (if you decide to stay here, pay a few extra dollars and valet!). Next I learn my reservation didn't exist in their system. I showed several email confrmations and they promised to fix by the time I checked out in the morning. When I get up and attempt to check out, I come to find they have double charged me for the room and refused to call Hotwire to resolve.  The rooms are really nice, especially for the price, but be prepared to walk an extensive amount and struggle through the most complex set of twists, turns, multiple elevator rides and frustration to get to your room. It took us 10-15 minutes to reach our room each time we entered the property.

1510,JXS5uSc0lMPMl_JOkJq6Kg,0,2014-06-28,0,nuEuQ7Rw4QqZ8FBVaMq47w,5,I have to be honest - I feel for the girls who had a poor experience at this David's Bridal...but I personally had the complete opposite experience.  I walked in one day on the spur of the moment with my fiancé, and made an appointment for later in the week (when he wouldn't be there).  When I arrived with my mom that morning, I was greeted promptly by the friendly girl at the desk.  She got basic info from me on what I was looking for/budget/etc.  We then were led to the fitting area with my consultant, Tatiana.  After reviewing what I was looking for, she started to pull a few dresses at a time for me to try on.  She took the time to ask me what I liked and didn't like from each of my dresses.  She was really sweet, professional, and genuine.  I told myself I wasn't going to buy a dress at my first appointment ever...but after 3 hours of trying on dresses, and trying my favorites back on a second time...I selected the gown of my dreams!  Not only was I never rushed, or ever made to feel like I was just a sale, my consultant Tatiana made me feel like an instant friend for the day.  She didn't try to blow through my budget and bring me dresses that were on the high end of my budget - she really did try her best to make me feel amazing and beautiful.  I ended up picking a dress that wasn't even what I had in mind - and I'm so glad for it!  The manager was also very polite and my mom and I were happy she took the time to introduce herself to us.  Yes the store had other brides, and yes there were others looking in the mirrors, and yes my consultant had to split her time...but it's such an exciting moment - I didn't realize how much time was passing, and it took some pressure off to not have her there standing by me the whole time, allowing me to talk to my mom about each dress.  As someone who also works in guest service, I can tell you Tatiana was great at multi-tasking - she gave me all the time I needed, and when she was working with me, she had her focus completely on me.  When I came back to the store a few weeks later to pick up my ordered sash, I had another great experience!  The lady at the desk this time also greeted me, and helped me find the headpieces (since I now wanted to try them on too)!  A consultant who was in the area was really kind, and he asked me if I needed help, and offered suggestions for what I was looking for.  When I finally made my way to the counter an pick up what I was actually there to get (my order), the manager and consultant there were both great...I am honestly blown away with it all, because I know it's rare to find that level of incredible service from a large chain.  Thank you, Tatiana, and the whole crew at this David's Bridal location!  I'll be sure to come back and get all my bridesmaid dresses / accessories very soon.  :),1,dl69uaA2E0Ee2x7kyhNWQA

It took me about 40 minutes on the Queen streetcar  to get here after work... but it was worth it. Since it was the end of the day, they had already run out of many of their sweet baked treats (even after apparently baking 3 day's worth of things) but I grabbed a vanilla cupcake with butter cream frosting, a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and a gluten free butter tart (and a non gluten free butter tart). They were all delicious. The cupcake was spongy and fluffy, the icing sweet, whipped, and not stiff at all. I was especially partial to the GF butter tart.

Friendly service, and great interior design. I loved the overhead lights - they're freaking lamps made from giant beaters, plus every table had fresh flowers on it. One word sums this place up -  adorable. (In two words - adorably delicious.) I love the random jars with stuff in it aesthetic. Lots of greens and neutral tones.

Also - wifi.Free functional wifi. There are outlets all over the place if you look for them (one main one that I know of is right at the front corner with the comfy seating. Yes.

While the staff is accommodating the manager Justin Parker will interrupt and make rude comments.  Be aware the deposit for this location is $300 or $100+cost of the rental, which ever is higher.  I was not aware of this unusual policy and when I said the airport location doesn't charge a $300 deposit, Justin said Well go and rent from there, that is our policy, and he glared at me.  Then my daughter offered her Visa debit card and they said she had to have 2 Utility bills with her name on it....really, who travels with two of their utility bills immediately in their possession?  We were unable to rent the car, they close in 1-hour and the wedding we had to drive to was in 3 hours.  Then Justin Parker (the manager), told the driver take these ladies back to where ever, really loud in the office, it was humiliating.  A good manager shows leadership and has the skills to handle a difficult situation, not insult customers and send them on their way with tacky behavior and rude remarks.  It was weird, like he got some kind of thrill showing off how he could treat us.  

I have rented from Enterprise for at least 20 years, and this is the first time I have ever been treated in such a shabby manner.

She really knows her stuff about hair and is a color correction specialist. Before I moved out to Arizona (originally grew up in NY), my hair was bleach blonde and I never liked it. My hair dresser back in NY LOVED blonde and so kept making my hair lighter with each visit. I did not have the heart to yell at her and say stop coloring my hair the color YOU want it to be. When I met Annie, the experience was ENTIRELY different!!! The first thing she asked me was what I envisioned for my hair color, what I did not like about it, and how I thought it would be perfect. Another thing she said was that anytime I was bored with my hair to feel free to tell her and she would revolutionize it again. She stayed true to her promise in the now two years that I have been seeing her. I also LOVE that if I want something new done to my hair and it is not fashion forward, she will work with the idea until it is. It always comes out even better than the original thought!!! I keep telling her that she needs to start her own product line too so hopefully that is to come soon!!! :D

As far as the vintage portion...Miles runs that. It always has intriguing items that are not what you would expect to find just anywhere. I have personally not made a purchase yet, but my colleague and I went to 3rd Thursday and she bought a door for $5!!! There is not even where to have lunch for that price! Miles gave her helpful suggestions as to how to recreate the door into a unique piece of art with either using pictures and turning it into a giant frame or using it as a room divider. Pretty cool!!! I am excited to see what my first purchased item will be someday!

Let me start by saying the hop is a club crawl. Meaning you walk through the casinos to get to the various clubs. 

To start, we met at Mandalay's House of Blues.  The House of Blues was the first stop. We went in for about 15 minutes then walked to the second location which was the Foundation room also located at Mandalay hotel. After that, our tour director (lol) walked us to the third club L.A.X(Luxor).  By then our feet hurt from all the walking so no one went inside the club. We sat outside the club until it was time for the next destination. If we had known this was a club walk, we would have worn walking shoes. 

Following LAX , we finally got on the over booked party bus (There were not enough seat). Luckily two individuals decided to abandon the field trip after walking to LAX. Anyway, the fun began on the bus where we were served watered down premixed drinks. We danced and got a little wild until rain water started leaking into the bus from the overhead emergency exit. The Party host did seem to care that we were getting rained on. 

Due to the rain, we skipped the Vegas sign photo op. 

Finally, the final destination and the end of the hop was the Chateau club located in the Paris hotel. This club was hopping and we partied for a couple  hours. 

Don't waste your money. You'd be better off renting your own limo bus.  Note to Posh... Include in your description , be prepared for a lot of walking.,1,QK2DUh-wJ1JQvunQKA5KTg

My family and I enjoyed their baby lamb chops and the boneless chicken thighs the most - moist, delicious and large servings! (we also tried the chaplee, chicken breast kabob and shish kabob). Again, the combos offered are of very good value...good amount of meat, a large piece of naan (which was a little bland and not as soft as the Indian naan we're used to) and good serving of fresh salad with every combo. 

The people working there were also very nice, welcoming and helpful. Will return and try the tandoori chicken they also offer. Note: their website mistakenly says they open at 12pm everyday, but when we arrived on Sunday, they did not open until 1pm!,2,eMV-UMb733EHCFe-TG-SFg
1590,JpgVl3d20CMRNjf1DVnzGA,0,2017-09-11,0,tuqLUCL3165DZEWoQFX7ng,2,It's not typical for my husband and I to try restaurants that have unusual name, not recommended by someone we know, nor because we're not the adventurous kind. Unless it's the only thing open and we're dying of hunger, maybe there's a slight chance. And if it weren't for the voucher we got, this restaurant ain't in our list to try when in Vegas, but it was a win-win, good opportunity to try since it's free dinner (with exceptions of: dessert, alcohol, tax, and gratuity)!

We were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. Our server named Juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should I say was too busy  favoring the group before us. It made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. But what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which I felt Juan didn't deliver well. 

I had Brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! Bucca di Beppo or Bravo's, all located in Hawaii probably could have done a better version. It's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing I liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! My husband had Surf & Turf Rodizio with unlimited meat serving and my in-laws had Grilled Salmon and Skirt Steak (not part of this review) while my child had Loaded Cheese Fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all OTS because we have a picky eater). 

Going back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. They seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. Not a big fan of dead carcass (I'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so I can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but I can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service. 

To end the night, we had some confusion with our server Juan. I should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. Like who does that? I guess only Pampas Brazilian Grille! Or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. Plus, the way Juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! Instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. And call me stingy or whatever, but I didn't like the force tipping impression! That's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. At that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because I had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so I can go on with my dinner. Plus it's not even ice cold! They charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. There was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.

Giving it two stars only because it was free dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner! Go get that voucher as a VISA card instead!,1,V7tDW7E-VRyqPqbGdsuueA

MAKE MAKE MAKE RESERVATIONS!

Decided to leave this place as our last meal in Vegas and I wouldn't want to have it any other way. Our server made our experience 10x times better. He was extremely attentive and friendly. He knew when to stop by and when not to. He knew what to recommend and to describe how everything was prepared. I will never forget asking him what the special of the night was and how well he described it that I had to ordered it. Beef Wellington. Unfortunately, they had run out of it. So he recommended I got the filet mignon, as this is what the restaurant is well known for. I do not regret listening to him. The steak was cooked perfectly. Medium never tasted so good. My brother had the filet mignon as well but his was with mashed potatoes and mine with fries. I ended up leaving him without mashed potatoes because they were too good for me not to eat them off his plate. They were creamy, fluffy and soft at the same time. 

No wonder this place is always packed. 

They will definitely be seeing me again.,3,e3s1x4LLqfSkRTWDy_-Urg

It literally takes an hour to an hour and a half to deliver food. Seriously. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Doesnt matter if we order at 8am, 10am or 1pm. Never fails, they take F-O-R-E-V-E-R. If you dont get what you ordered or you are upset by them delivering your breakfast around LUNCH time, be ready to have the owner talk down to you and be a total bitch to you for i dont know, just wanting what you pay for?! 

Its over priced. But its decently tasteful food. Takes forever. Owners a witch. And i'm pretty sure that they continuing forget to pack my extra ranch just to piss me off. 

End Rant. 

PS- I've never gone in there to eat because i frankly, i'd rather tip the nice delivery driver then the ignorant imbeciles that work in the dining area.

Also, if more people in Phoenix reviewed we could probably avoid most of these overpriced robberies. 

I ordered a cocktail that was actually pretty good. Something with sparkling wine and muddled sage I believe. My Mom had a mango martini. That was also pretty good. They are apparently 'known for their martinis'. Though I find it really hard to believe that they're known for anything. 

As an appetizer we had caprese. It was 12 bucks and came with four tomato slices that were not ripe, four pieces of impostor buffalo mozzarella and a flake of basil. Hands down the worst I have ever had. 

Next came the salads. These were made up of a few greens and half a tomato. Seriously? 

For my entree I ordered a mixed veggie type pasta with oil and garlic. 20 bucks down the drain. My boyfriend had the 'special' which was Cioppino. It was 36 dollars and his stomach is feeling ever dollar of it. 

We took our left overs because we just do that and don't want to be wasteful. On the way home the smell of it was so bad we had to pull over to toss it out. 

This place is a crock. They couldn't get me to eat here again at fast food prices. 

For 4 people (And only 2 cocktails) our bill came out to 180 bucks. What a rip off.,2,eI9k9DORq7KyB7-oMv9WSg
4555,MzjfSbFFTEVlX4Lp2kHg_Q,2,2011-05-25,0,SSM8AKnHtAk7Ajdp5wgMeA,5,My chicken lived a healthy, happy life. She was lovingly cared for, allowed to roam the yard, and fed fresh corn and barley. How do I know? The other day I was going to my neighbourhood grocery store to buy a whole chicken. You know the type of bird I mean. It sits in those refrigerated, glass boxes at the back of the store; the only indication it was ever a chicken at all is the familiar sight of wings and breast meat. As its lifeless body sits there, I can't ever imagine this thing having feathers, breathing, living. Truth be told, buying that chicken is a mostly unceremonious experience that people rarely give a second thought to.

But something spectacular happened to me that day. I didn't buy that chicken; I didn't even get to the grocery store. On my way there, I noticed the Butcher by Nature storefront, and I felt compelled to check it out and see what all this 'By Nature' business was all about.

Butcher by Nature gives life to that lifeless chicken. Much like purchasing pedigree, the butcher and owner, Frank, knew all about my chicken and all the other chickens he was selling for that matter. He knew the farmers personally, and he knew that they were passionate about raising animals. He spoke proudly about the pesticide-free and natural-focused environment the farmers raised their livestock in. Clearly, this is a different kind of eating.

The shop is fairly small, but truly cozy, and the store is classic with more butchery area than retail shop. The retail area has shelves lined with locally-sourced dry products, like jams and honey, and fridges lined with locally-sourced meat products, like duck and eggs. Butcher by Nature also has a passionate, knowledgeable owner. Actually, forget that last bit; calling Frank knowledgeable is an understatement. The art and science of butchery is seemingly ingrained in his bones. Much like those chicken's proud lineage, Frank was raised to do butchery.

Pesticide-free, hormone-void, locally-sourced meats, combined with an experienced owner and a pleasant store-front is what Butcher by Nature is all about. And of course, they're not limited to just chickens. They carry quite a large variety of meat including duck, venison, pork, and beef; all of it butchered and prepared in a bunch of different ways.
Fear not. Eating all this organic natural stuff isn't for just the rich. In fact, most of the products at Butcher by Nature are actually reasonably priced. In most cases, you can expect to pay just a few bucks more than you would at the neighbourhood grocery store. That, combined with the absolute passion surrounding what they carry makes it an easy choice for meat. Even if you're not in the area, Butcher by Nature is worth the trip.

So, if you think that chickens, or most other animals for that matter, magically end up in refrigerated, glass boxes at the back of a grocery store, then you owe it to yourself to check out Butcher by Nature because when it comes to meat, it's all about where it comes from.,5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

We were quickly seated at the bar, and noticed that there was a strong hot air draft where we were seated. It was very hard to breathe and my eyes were getting dry but this was quickly turned off when the waiter noticed that I was trying to find the source of hot air. Sign of good customer service. 

We ordered a variety of items on the menu including smoked monkfish liver, beef tongue and many different skewers. I really enjoyed the monkfish liver - it was actually my favorite dish of the night. The beef tongue was okay, a little chewy but good flavors. Very smokey. Upon tasting the first skewers that came out, my boyfriend commented on the temperature of the grill, that it wasn't hot enough. While I don't know much about grilling or temperatures, I trust his judgement in this area. As we received the rest of our skewers, each one had more char, and better flavor and texture. 

Of the skewers we ordered, my favorites were the liver, pork cheek, and pork belly. My least favorite was the sasami or chicken tenderloin; I found it a little dry and not enough flavor. 

I believe that there is great potential here at kintori, and will eventually live up to the standards set by its Guu counterpart.,0,hJulW1s6tOBr2NXD9nAoMQ

Spacious room with lots of natural light. Sunday morning breakfast for 2, arrived at 9:30 and seated right away. 

Room wasn't full, but at least 5 other tables near us were people who had placed orders and waiting for food. 

Server was pleasant and took our order (a skillet and an egg dish (clearly not memorable)). Coffee came after maybe 10mins. Still drinking mine when refills were circling nearby tables. Didn't see this happen the rest of the time I was there (had to flag someone down).

Maybe i should have read more in advance but I was still shocked that it took 50mins to get our food after we ordered. Being able to see the open kitchen and no one looking like they were working very hard was extra frustrating. Our server disappeared after serving the first coffees and at 45mins in, I asked someone about how much longer it might be for the food. There was no apologetic tone or anything out of the ordinary. I went early to avoid waiting but was starving by the time the food arrived.

The food was tasty and not a bad price for a decent portion. The service, the slowness, not my thing. I can understand leisurely meals or waiting when the room is full or the staff are busting their butts. This wasn't the case. 

I likely won't return. But tip for anyone who does - order the scones with your breakfast. Saw other tables get those early on, probably tides you over to distract from the extremely long wait. Don't look at the kitchen either or it may make you question why they can't move any faster than a snail's pace with the cooking,0,vexkrpa0-IAZ_j5z7ZJyxg

We tried it out, and let me tell you, it was awesome. Their portions were just right, and even though I was full when we left, I didn't feel gross like I do at other restaurants. I had the BBQ chicken pizza, and I loved it. Thin, flatbread crust made for a light pizza, very tasty pizza. My wife had the chicken Caesar salad. She gets that salad so often that she knows her Caesars, and she said this was her favorite dressing. And the chicken of course was amazing as well.,0,dejaCG65dfs1VuyXZbt-kg

Favs are the apple fritters (they let you chose from lighter or darker ones, depending on how done you like them), and their old fashioned buttermilk.  The donuts on the top two rows of the case are vegan,  but you'd never know it.  Their chocolate glazed cream filled (soymilk) and glazed raspberry jelly (gelatin-free) are crazy good.  I dream of these things.  Hole-in-the-wall smack dab in Chinatown.  The owner & her husband are as sweet as can be.  I only wish they were open 24 hours!,1,dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg

You can walk in and right away fall in love with the place. 

Adding to it is the food ! The burgers are juicy and well made, they aren't like the other fast food where the burger has bad presentation. They have everything a buyer needs and you can even adjust it to your pleasure.The wait is a little long but its worth it. The fries are the best I've tried, they are crispy and have great flavor.

Prior to moving to Arizona, I was affiliated with University hospitals, and saw only physicians I personally knew to be excellent, often leaders in their fields.  However, after moving to AZ awhile back, I did not have the connections or the knowledge of the local health care professionals to afford me this luxury.

I found Dr. Perez to be the epitome of professionalism both in terms of competence and bedside manner.   

His office, internet portal, and staff are all top notch, which I consider secondary to competence and bedside manner, but it sure makes things more pleasant.

I arrived 2 hours early for my appointment due to my own mistake, and I was fit in between patients within 15 minutes.  Despite this, my visit with Dr. Perez was thorough, which is difficult these days given the time restraints primary care physicians often face.

This restaurant is another product of a bad trend happening in Toronto. A mediocre restaurant that somehow gets great reviews from pretentious rags such as Toronto Life, Globe and Mail, etc. and the virulent contagion spreads to the minds of every subsequent reviewer and patron of said 'trendy' locale.

The food at this restaurant is just OK. It deserves no better than 2/5 stars. My partner and I eat out a lot and this might be the most overhyped restaurant we've tried in the past 24 months. Avoid.,5,r5Sk34LR3WmEw4bzFBY_oQ

The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the enforcing of the rules by the teenage lifeguards at the lazy river. They are afraid to tell the guests not to horseplay or run around the lazy river.

Another drawback is that 3 days in a row either the pool or lazy river was completely shutdown due to biohazards which means someone defecated or vomited in the water! Totally gross.,1,E7PoXTT0MVc8xcayikQnsA

It's a tiny space, but houses a nice variety of in house made tea blends. I didn't think the selection was really that small, but I think it's a sign of quality. Kind of like a carefully selected wine list at a restaurant rather than I here is every single wine we could buy ever list.

Service has been lovely.  The owner is consistently a nice, helpful person, and answers questions about tea and recommends things as needed.

They've got a nice variety of in house made tea blends. But since I'm a creature of habit (at least with tea) I will probably just order an earl grey or a cacao tea probably forever. I like that the cacao is from Chocosol, and that the tea tastes like some kind of chocolate magic, while still being light.

Then when my order was finally ready, the hash browns and bacon were overcooked (almost burned in some spots) and looked old, like they had been sitting out a long time.

Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman, and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.

Three hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...

Momofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.

With the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.

As you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.

First we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!

Next came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!

We then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudité; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.

And then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.

Lastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,

We decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.

All in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic. Good friends and good food - what could be better?,2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

That being said, the establishment was decent (as good or better than expected for a non-formal dining setting) and the food that I got in the lunch special was terrific. The basmati rice has a great flavor that went well with their curries.  With a range from somewhat spicy to very spicy, the flavor was delicious across the two curries and the soup/curry (whatever the third item in the lunch special was today).  The naan was average; I have had some better naan, but it served its purpose alongside the curries. The rice pudding (Kheer maybe?) was pretty good, but I'm not a big dessert person so I could take it or leave it, but it was nice after the spicy curries. The place was clean, I ordered and had my food within about 5 minutes or less and the guy taking orders was friendly.

Don't be afraid to fix or update your gadgets with them instead of buying new ones. You will save a lot of money and get most of the new features. However, they do have a lot of different phones at great prices that you can buy from them if you choose.

1562,RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,0,2012-07-31,0,SMbAV2io0tGBGisi81L6dg,4,This is by far one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte based off of a couple of things. 1. The menu is very vast (almost too vast at points though) so you are bound to find something that suits your fancy. 2. The atmosphere is great - crowded but not too crowded, cool artwork on the walls, awesome bar with a giant salt water fish tank that spans the front wall, great outdoor seating by the fountain if that suits your fancy. 3. The food is YUM (the Bento box is my favorite as you get a little of everything, burger and sushi). 4. Love that when you enter the bathroom the background music is 3 voice where one is a sentence in English, one in Redneck and one in Japanese!  5. The service has always been top notch! 6. They have a combination burger and sushi option that is called Burgushi...novel ideal! 

Biggest draw back to me is that there is ALWAYS a wait and reservations are hard to come by unless you make then well in advance. Also, not a fan of no drink specials on the weekend.  

Overall, a fun place that I will continue to support.,0,PX8qhpo8bwoxS7A9ivZlfQ

I usually love their brunch but my food on Sunday was not good nor was our service.  I had the breakfast pita and I could not eat more than a bite of it, it just tasted really bad.  And this was weird based on the fact that some of my favorite foods had gon einto its preparation!  Spinach and cucumber sauce, egg and cheese and pita... should be delicious.  It was not.  

Our water and tea glasses were empty the entire meal, and we asked several times for refills to no avail.  

They do have excellent sangria and a nice wine list.  I guess I will stick to my standards:  fruit and granola for brunch, hummus and cheese plate for appies with wine.

3410,KK7H1bVOMAJnDqMhBv2zpA,0,2016-11-05,0,G9OUiuCy5eTmgpIGjYehMg,4,Came on a recommendation from a friend. We had the chilli chicken dry, the chilli shrimp dry, the Manchurian mix fried rice and the chicken pakoras. 

My favourite dish was the Manchurian Mixed Fried Rice - it was just the right level of spice - it's definitely got some kick to it so if you aren't a big spicy food eater you might want to ask them to tone it down. Portion size was huge! We had enough for lunch and dinner the next day. 

Underwhelming was the chicken pakoras - they were not that great compared to others we have had from at other Hakka places. They were also quite pricy for what you were getting. They also came last which was a bit odd since usually they come as appetizers. We were halfway through our meal when they arrived and only had one each since our plates were full. 

I know people rave about the prices at this place but it was only reasonable - not a super great deal. Our go to Hakka place is about 20 dollars cheaper and it's good food too! 

I would still come again though,0,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

Similar in atmosphere and menu to Morton's, the Capital Grille is located on the ground floor of the former Lazarus building at the corner of Wood & Fifth.

Expect dark paneled wood, a massively overpriced (300% and up) wine list, and oil paintings of Pittsburgh's forefathers (including Mr. Rogers).  The little things, like impeccable service by the bartenders, and umbrellas to your car on rainy nights by the valet staff, are refereshing. 

Regarding the food - appetizers were just ok. I'd give a big thumbs up to the any of the dry aged steaks (simple and delicious and the house speciality) and a thumbs down to the Filet Oscar (Filet Mignon topped with lump crabmeat and a bearnaise sauce).  Also, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries (if you like truffles) - these are to die for. Desserts are nothing special - I'd give a pass on the key lime pie. 

When I go back, it's straight to the dry aged steak and truffle fries for me.,4,AlzerMK7z84E4KU6GjPzIQ

I've dined here several times and I have had nothing but great experiences. The food is always spot on. I guess you could say it's pricey, but I really don't take that into consideration unless the food is bad, and in this case it isn't. $60 per person is a solid average price, I think. More if you want a lot of drinks.

Wine list is really great. Go for the bottle rather than the glass.

The cake is out of this world. Always. Get. The. Cake.

This is one of the best spots in Madison for a dinner or even a small snack after work during the week. As far as Tory Miller restaurants go, this one is probably second or third best after L'etoile and possibly Graze (maybe a tie).,2,Q7KAsXblnS5rWGAeHzLmJw

The groupon included wine tasting (with storytelling), wine tour, souvenir wine glass and a full bottle of wine. Yes, there's a dog walking around and a red solo cup for dumping waste, but its a really nice vibe to me. They have rocking chairs, picnic tables, corn hole, a lake and lots of greenery.

The food is simple, a little plain but good. Never gotten fries here but the hummus is smooth and has a nice flavor with good quality olive oil, the pitas are warm and fresh (and you get  two so they will fill you up) and I actually like the kufta here better than Layalina's which is saying something because I love that place (but am not a fan of their kufta). Lentil soup is also tasty and filling. The  falafel does leave something to be desired.

I also don't mind the guy behind the counter. If you absolutely must be kowtowed to with fake enthusiasm and mock-pleasure to serve you this is not your place. This guy smiles at you its genuine.,0,qnMR9YDAZuWP1ufBM_pKhg

The young boy & woman servers were rude & had a vibe that we didn't appreciate. When I go somewhere I want to feel welcomed. 

Our server had an attitude as if she didn't want to be there waiting on us. I had the Philly cheese steak & my mother had the American Burger. My sandwich had more onion and peppers then meat. When I want a Philly Cheese Steak I want to to have some steak, not a bun overstuffed with onions & peppers. My plate was messy, as soon as he put it down everything started falling off onto the table. 

My mother was not even a bite into her sandwich when it all started falling apart. The bread seemed to be old and dried out, it kept crumbling up and everything fell out. She stopped eating after that, and when she asked to get it taken off the bill since she barely had anything to eat, our server gave off that negative vibe again. 

Finally as we were leaving, we were getting ready to pay and our server told the young boy to check us out, she told him to take off my moms food and he just gave us this look and rolled his eyes. We asked for military discount which was nice that they had since places never seem to do it anymore. I still don't understand how my philly steak & an ice tea came out to $22. By then we were just over this place and wanted to leave. This place was dirty & just a negative vibe from the start. Never coming here again.

I've decided to count, from entering an establishment to the time our party is spotted to the time we are acknowledged or helped (no, I don't  speed count). This visit, it was 5 before we were spotted and 82 before a hostess came to seat us.

Place was clean, server prompt, nice. Salmon was dry, overcooked. Walnut and tempura shrimp were good but warm/cool, not hot. Liked the tofu and veggies. Fried prawns were tasty. Crab legs? Crab legs, nothing spectacular. The fried rice? Hardened, couldn't pay me to eat it. All the meat dishes, with the exception of almost well done prime rib (not happy that there was no one at the carving station to cut or anyone to call and ask) had an after taste of cough medicine - so did the tapioca, but cake was ok.

Also almost got run over by the hostess while on my way to get food, she was rushing toward the empty side of the restaurant. My response? Smile, and an 'oh, sorry excuse me.' Hers a raised eyebrow that became a frown and a parting huff. Wanna pay over $20 for that plus tax and tip? Go for it lol, I'll pass.,1,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ

I requested a gel manicure and spa pedicure with callous remover. I was very disappointed with my experience. I was there for over 2 hours. My manicurist didn't dry my feet or legs before putting lotion on and didn't provide the full service. The lady next to me had got stones and a nice leg massage... needless to say I did not revive that and my callous is still very visible. My manicure was a complete disaster. My nails were not fully painted and the manager just told me to come back whenever I want to get it fixed. He didn't bother to really take a look or apologize. I will not be refunding. I should have known it was not going to be a great experience when I walked in and there're was only one customer. Usually Saturday's at my original salon are packed.

We had wanted to try this place since it opened and were lured inside by their fish taco's on the display menu.
We sat outside to their lovely patio.

We indeed ordered the Fish Taco's, pulled pork taco's AND the calamari salad because we were hungry.

The food was okay - but unfortunately there wasn't a lot of it - so we also left hungry and ended up at the Loblaws sushi counter to satisfy our initial craving and persistent hunger.

The portions are really small for what you pay. I expect more than one grilled calamari tube and a small heap of 'greens' when a salad is 15$ 

The fish taco's had the equivalent of one thumb size portion of fish. The Pulled pork taco's we slightly more generous.

Again the food was palatable, but not so amazing as to justify the portions vs. value.

Have a beer on their patio, but if you are hungry, and you don't want to go broke satiating your hunger, this might not be the place for you based on what we ordered.,0,-gtyNPUaHRCkTxgMfSVM7g

We were hungry, and 5 & Diner was one of the Groupon Now! options.  I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there, but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke.  As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget.  (I had a sip, and I can verify that he speaks the truth.)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted.  My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well.  Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.

Basically I paid $66/night to stay in this hotel. I would not have minded that if the hotel was just honest about it. I think that it was very sneaky for them to practice such a thing.

The resort is huge. It's like an apartment complex and since we arrived late at night the grounds were so dark it was tough to find your duplex like room. It was nice that we were connected only to another room. The grounds were clean and quiet. The bed was soft and comfy. The AC was cold and loud. It had room for 2 people and a kid. The furniture was old and the the tv in the living room and bedroom was ancient. I did not even try and use it. The in room safe actually uses a key..lol (not code).

The room has old stained carpet and the ceilings have beams. The bathroom was old and small. On our first night we actually had no hot water in our room. We showered in lukewarm water. I called the front desk to report it and the lady acted like I was bothering her. The next day at 830 am, thank God we were already awake, with our DND sign on the door we get the maintenance people at our door minimizing our no hot water complain. I insisted they check and surprise, surprise it was broken! I demanded to be moved to another room.

The man on the phone who moved us was probably the only normal person there. He was appropriate  and helpful.  The rest of the staff in this facility have no customer service skills. They just don't care.

They also put a $100 hold on your CC when you check in. I am waiting for them to remove that on my CC or I will definitely dispute it.

I would not recommend anyone to stay here. Except for the soft bed and extra pillows there is nothing here to write home about. There are a lot of other places in Scottsdale that will appreciate your business and you can get more for your money. Stay away!,5,qr9hmaIxq1z9ycgT28PpRw

What a joke. I signed up online filling out application, I was called from a salesman at Larry Miller Fiat, come on down we can get you in a car, we own the bank, Prestige Financial, what a joke!. He looked online at all there dealerships looking for the RIGHT car, he found one. 2010 Chevrolet Cobalt, I have never been in jail but I have seen jail cell movies that the jail cell looked cleaner, yea it had new tires and low 60k miles but  it was nasty inside. Like $366 for 66months and you can trade it after making 12 payments, yea right who wants a 2010 Cobalt you still owe 10k on lol.

Situated at the main entrance of Bayview, now in its third year of business at the mall, and judging by the patrons that came through in our lengthy Saturday afternoon visit, this place is a hit with the locals. Being situated in a bit more of an upscale mall, Aux Delices caters to their clientele. Health conscious foodies will delight in their selection of fresh, gourmet ingredients, including Panini's, pastas, crepes, salads, and even specialties like duck l'orange and homemade gelato, just to name a few. There menu is ever changing, depending on seasonal availability, so there is always something new to try at Aux Delices.

We started our meal with the fresh manicotti and roasted mushroom caps, duck l'orange with mushroom and greens, and roasted eggplant salad. Everything tasted like fresh, home cooking. The manicotti ($6.50) was amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth ricotta, and ripe tomatoes that tasted like they were picked form the garden that morning. The stuffed Portobello mushroom cap with cheese and polenta was an awesome side dish, complementing the Italian flavours in the manicotti, but would be great as an entrée on its own.

The duck l'orange was cooked perfectly, tender and succulent, the sauce was sweet and tangy, and the accompanying side salads of oyster mushrooms and greens, and roasted eggplant were in a league of their own. I would have returned just to try a sampling of all their fresh veggie salads.

Next up, a roasted vegetable Panini, recommended by our host. The yellow pepper, red onion and eggplant were soft and easy to eat, with a nice portion of goat cheese on lovely focaccia bread. Moving into crepe territory, we decided to tackle the ham and cheese crepe ($9.50), with tomatoes as well, and would go back for more. Their crepes are light and fluffy, and packed with ingredients. Even better, your crepe is made right in front of you, and you can add any ingredients you like. A fun experience for kids, too.

For those looking for the café experience, they serve up delightful illy coffee, and Rahier desserts, that almost make you feel like you are dining in Europe. Their double espressos were great, nice and bold, and the latte was perfect, frothy and steamed to perfection. The homemade gelato was amazing. I love ice cream, and have been a latecomer to the gelato trend, but I am glad that I tried it. We sampled the chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, a must when having gelato, and they were all very well done. The vanilla and chocolate especially, both true to their flavours, with a natural, nuttier taste, rather than overtly sweet.

Aux Delices Café offers a fabulous dining experience, and allows you to stop in for a fast and easy meal, or linger over a cup of coffee and a pastry. All of their meals are available to go, making it a great option to stop in after work for a ready-made meal.
Gourmet meals ready as soon as you order, great coffee and homemade gelato should have you stopping for a break on your next shopping trip.,0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

It was extremely frustrating being asked multiple times for the same docs and having my closing date delayed at least twice due delays on their part ( they actually contacted my seller and explained that they were the reason for the closing delay).  The final mixup was on the day of closing when they included impounds in my final payment when a i had clearly requested and  signed documents saying I did not.  They acknowledged the error and  told me the docs would have to go back to underwriting again, thus causing another delay in closing. I knew that my seller would not go for a 3rd delay and I knew I had a good deal on the table.  I was told that the  impounds could possibly be removed during the servicing process, so I accepted the current situation and closed the loan with the mpounds to eliminate my risk.  I was not happy.  I  am still waiting to see if they will actially remove the i mpounds, but am not hopeful.  .  I am very disappointed and would not recommend FFS to anyone.,2,xXz5_03m8Q6ARLA4fq_f1w

We didn't feel too welcome at all by the manager because we bought our 2 girls with us who behaved very well and it felt too upper class to even go there with kids even if they are older. Not a place to go with kids even though kids are allowed. 

The lasagne was good but a bit burnt on top which I didn't like. The Alfredo pasta was flavourless. Not too good. Was disappointed that they had no pizza for a month when we went there. 

The waitress was sweet. But the manager ignored us and went for the people who looked like they had more money to spend and talked to them about the variety of wines. 

There was a sign when I came in that said something like no hats allowed or take off your hats. That was fine with me but a bit taken aback by that sign which kind of set the negative tone in a sense. 

Don't think I would go again because it felt like setting a foot in a stranger's house and felt awkward there. Food was good though but hard to enjoy myself.,0,CIWmICxK1NMixvIgb5nlAg

It took forever to get our food, and when we did get it, my burger came out wet and soggy?

On top of that, the cashier who was taking my order was giving me dirty looks when I was nothing but polite. Not really sure how I offended her but ok..... 

Bottom line - I don't get annoyed easily but this place is the one exception. Please don't waste your hard earned cash here when there are about a billion other burger joints in this town. So not worth it!!!!!,0,R5p2iFSrj2JlZ2H_xNg6tg

3721,nWW6fBfBljiRFa4sG7TyxA,1,2013-04-07,1,Zm2NfZ3vL8XVNITm6cl5gw,2,Surprised to see this place rated 4 stars on Yelp. I came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday evening for a quick bite and we found our meal extremely substandard.

The draft beer and wine lists were solid and the cocktails were pretty good, so no complaints there. The food menu was focused, but one lingering question hovered over us while we browsed it:

Where the hell is the bacon?

For a restaurant with pork-themed fare, there were disappointingly few dishes that contained bacon. Plenty of pâté, tenderloin and belly but no bacon. It just seemed weird.

The cheese plate was very tasty and reasonably priced - $10 for three cheeses, toast points/crackers and small samples of red wine poached pears and roasted beets. The beets were the only thing out of place on the plate, and although this was the high point of the meal, it's hard to give Black Pig credit for something extremely difficult to screw up.

For the entree, I ordered the croque monsieur ($13) and my girlfriend ordered the pork tenderloin ($19). My sandwich arrived and was ENORMOUS. The thing was slightly larger than my face and came with a mountain of pommes frites (Black Pig's terminology). It looked like something Adam Richman should tackle on a Man Versus Food challenge.

The huge portion size to price ratio couldn't save the uninspiring flavors. The fries were ridiculously salty and I didn't even bother taking the sandwich home despite leaving about 3/4 of it on the plate. 

Despite costing $6 more, the pork tenderloin dish was much smaller and tasted as bland as it looked - plenty of brown and green on the plate but very little flavor. The pork was juicy at least, so not a total loss.

Overall it was an extremely disappointing experience. The food couldn't live up to the menu, which overhypes its descriptions with meaningless adjectives - free range toad-in-a-hole, nettled risotto.

We'll probably come back for drinks, but my advice is skip the food.,3,0HCPrZgYOfWZKk-X6OnS4A

3604,zRqi6L1u-YmmVAHjeUbGMQ,0,2016-08-07,0,1aXrhLqtAu06LppGMlnG7g,3,Hello, today I visited SkinnyFATS for the first time.  I rated it 3 stars, parts of my visit were impressive, others were not.  Allow me to divulge.  The menu and food selection are great.  Wide variety of offerings, prices in-line with what you get.  I was impressed and excited to get on with my meal.  I ordered from the Things in Bowls section of the menu, and opted for the Smoke in a Bowl.  The meal was good, I would have it again, filled me up, plenty of chicken, plenty of vegetables, nice flavor.  It was good, nothing to write home about, but good.  One thing I noticed, not sure exactly what black bean salsa is at SkinnyFATS, but I didn't see a single black bean in my bowl.  It was very dark where I was sitting in the restaurant so maybe I just couldn't see it.

The customer service left a lot to be desired.  It's all about training your employees, some owners/ managers take it seriously, others don't.  The person that took my order was great, friendly, helpful, nice smile.  I should mention I was asked to provide ID as I was using my debit card.  I assume SkinnyFATS has been burned repeatedly by their customers using debit/ credit cards that don't belong to them, hence they card you, doesn't say much about their clientele overall.  Also, I ordered a Coke, I was truly surprised when I got to the soft drink fountain and Coke wasn't an option.  Seems that should have been mentioned to me.  The person that brought me my food, didn't say a word to me, not one.  I offered a Hello and a Thank You as my food was delivered... my words were completely ignored.  Very common courtesy dictates, especially in a retail/ business type of establishment that when offered a Hello or a Thank You by a customer, a simple reply is good business.  I assumed the person that delivered my food was having a bad day at work.  As I was enjoying my Smoke in a Bowl one of the staff was busy clearing and cleaning the table next to me.  As this person started to vigorously sweep the floor beneath and around the table next to me, I lost my appetite.  Sweeping the floor stirs up dust and whatever else is on the floor.  In my head I was imagining all sorts of debris floating around in the air and landing on my table and on top of my Smoke in a Bowl and in my off-brand Coke.  I was disgusted and soon stopped eating.

SkinnyFATS and another restaurant I consider to be very similar in concept, Greens and Proteins, are welcome additions to the Las Vegas restaurant scene in my opinion.  Next time I'll probably head to G&P where I always get top notch food AND service.,0,EmLSHnNmge833K98Gm1zMg

Not good when the temp is 113 degrees, no matter how many times the server refills your water. By the way, our service was good and efficient, and we liked the guacamole prepared tableside. Also, we liked the many vegetarian options and the way the shrimp tacos were prepared.

3596,jGe5sKmpIStORtVbsd9yyQ,0,2014-07-28,4,6Dy8c5JTFt5AoQQSC_SR-Q,1,I am so disappointed with this hospital. This was the second time I came here, and each time was a HUGE disappointment. I am never returning. EVER. The vet's name is Melissa Schupp. 

 First, I arrived around 2:35 on a Sunday afternoon. I called two hours ahead of time to schedule an appointment because I knew Sundays would be busy; this is because many other animal hospitals are not open on Sundays. My dog was suffering from unknown allergic reactions with skin rashes left and right. I had just adopted him, and his skin had recently become infected and rotten-smelling.
 I called ahead of time, gave my details , a $77 quote and they reserved a room for me. When I arrived  the room was already reserved and I was led straight in. I initially thought I was going to have a great experience because of the quick room preparation but BOY was I wrong. When I was led into the room that was prepared, there was water all over the floor and the front desk lady hastily used paper towels to clean it up. I waited the standard 30 minutes in the smelly room until the nurse came into to check details, run temperature and give my dog a general physical. Then she left for AN HOUR. By this time it  was already 3:35, and my dog was whining from pain and discomfort in a closed off room. When the nurse returned and began to write down symptoms, my dog actually started peeing on floor. I didn't know what to do because I had no cleaning materials with me, so the nurse stepped into action and dropped a few paper towels on the ground. She didn't manage to soak up all the urine, so when she moved around, my dog was pushed into it and it ended all over my clothes when she asked for my to carry my dog onto the checkup table.

To make things worse, she left again for another hour, and checked in after the 40 minute mark to tell me the veterinarian would be with me after 1 minute. Ten more minutes passed and no one came. My dog was whimpering more and more at this point. Finally at 4:30, the vet comes in, smiling and kind, and asking me for doggie symptoms. I ask her about fleas, but I swear, this place was so profit driven that the VET DID NOT EVEN CHECK MY DOG FOR FLEAS BEFORE GIVING ME A PRESCRIPTION ON MY FLEA MEDICATION. The mere mention of I think my dog might have fleas but I don't know how to check for them initiated a conditioned response I'll prescribe flea medication WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE DOG. I asked kindly to hint to her that my dog might not have fleas because the itchiness could be a symptom of allergies. She then shows me how to check for fleas, but doesn't find any as she shows me. She continued to write down a prescription for fleas on my bill without my knowing. Is this a professional business? How can they cheat people like this!
As I continued to ask questions to make sure what my dog had, the nurse seemed to reply with more things to run up my medical bill. She gave my dog a unnecessary skin scrape for mites TWICE even though SHE SAID that it didn't seem like my dog had mites, she performed and charged me for the scrape all the same. Because I had never needed to have these operations performed, I did not know that it was an extra $30 to have skin scraped. She went to look at the scrapes under the microscope, and returned another hour later. By this time, it was 5:30 and my patience was running low. For three hours, I sat in a stuffy room, covered in urine and staring at my miserable dog scratching his skin to bloody scabby bits as the doctors and nurses neglected the both of us. Honestly, I was so frustrated, I didn't even know what to do.  I had never experienced such a horrible medical visit. 

Around 5:35 when she returned, she apologized for being gone for an hour, and she said she had to look over a pet with a real emergency. I'm not here to disqualify her statement, because I understand that this is a real animal hospital and that other people may have pets who are dying. But I also understand that this is a FOR-PROFIT animal hospital, and if they don't even have enough vets to go around that I have to wait three hours for something that takes less than 50 minutes, I truly will never EVER recommend this place or ever set foot near this place again.
 After she came back, she confirmed my dog had no mites, and gave me a pet cone of shame that I had asked for earlier. She told me it was $15 cone, and gave me flea medication and antibiotics for the infection. She hardly looked at my pet. The only part of the visit that was clear to my mind was that she kept saying ow when my dog nibbled at her fingers.
I excitedly hurried out and paid my bill. EXCEPT IT WAS $207. I let the vet CUT MY DOG for $32, the flimsy cone was $30 in addition to the $29 un-needed flea meds. I cried.
I think my only mistake was coming to this hospital. Be wary of coming here as the more questions you ask to get a better idea of your dog's condition, the more services and products they try to shove down your throat to earn revenue.,10,0Q5EIFIxISWttluPPHh2ag

The staff is friendly. However, I feel they have not been properly trained in making the drinks they sell. 

The coffee beans are good quality however, sometimes the load is packed to tight and the espresso comes out with a burnt taste. Other times in a latte it is either too over heated or comes out like a cappuccino. 

In the simplest way put very inconsistent and not in anyway good. 


Some of the desserts are really over priced for the quality and quantity you are getting (i.e. Small Almond croissant $4.20) 


Today I ordered an Early Grey. The earl grey tea I had tasted moldy .... It also made me sick.... Which makes me question what type of hygiene they have there. 



Will not be going back to this place ever .... They are a disgrace to cafes. 


Tip* go to the Starbucks upstairs in the indigo or across the street... They are closer to what it should really taste like.... You will get the coffee, late, cappuccino or tea the way it should be done.,4,kBNFdviedCPFWyR-wVaAzw

If you are really hungry, try the 3-egg scramble (3 scrambled eggs mixed with grilled onions, peppers, sliced italian sausage, and melted cheddar cheese) - with Mancini toast (and butter). If you finish all of it, you probably won't need to eat again until dinner.

As mentioned, on the weekends, you can order sweet shrimp sashimi. At first, I was apprehensive about ordering it because I've had bad sweet shrimp at non-AYCE places, however, it was very fresh and good size (sometimes, sushi places have tiny, tiny sweet shrimps). 

Everything else on the menu was enjoyable, with very good portion sizes - small enough that you have the opportunity to try multiple items. For example, the rolls come in 4's, so you can try more than one roll. Another plus was the dessert. They have black sesame ice cream, which I've never seen at AYCE sushi before, along with other jellos (black current and litchi), mango pudding and a chef's special. 

While pricey, $24.99 on the weekends, I would say that its worth it.,0,hJulW1s6tOBr2NXD9nAoMQ

121,qDguZjZSYPOzq-je_EqO3w,3,2011-08-01,0,BP6XZmb7ugvc1De9mvoQpA,4,Bamburger is the latest entry into the inexpensive gourmet burger trend taking over Yonge Street, including Gourmet Burger Co., South Street Burger Co., Burger Shoppe and Gourmet Burger.

While Bamburger offers a decent take-out menu, we chose to enjoy their small, but friendly sidewalk patio, right in the middle of restaurant row at Yonge and Davisville. Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed diner feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.

Starting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.

The menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50), and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!

We went with the Bambamburger ($11.50), which is 2/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the Bambamburger, and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.

Bamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.

If you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.,8,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

This was disappointing. 

First off, it was really awkward sitting on the benches outside on the sidewalk, as people walked past us while to wait for our table. 

Second, when we were seated, it was so loud. It felt like we were in a high school cafeteria. There was so much noise from people talking over each other and from the loud music. We were just happy that we didn't have to share a table with another couple. 

Finally - Food was mediocre. I was extremely disappointed with the curry egg noodle dish. It was awkward to eat and I felt sick about half way through because the curry was too rich. On the flip side - I had a taste of my company's dish and it wasn't that great either - he had the beef stir fry dish with rice. The meat was nice and tender, but it wasn't flavourful. 

Wasn't worth the hype, unfortunately.,1,PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ

We were nicely greeted at the front though. Guess there was a disconnect between the hostess and waitstaff.,0,ic9zIsm7zoxUm3Axyegx8g
