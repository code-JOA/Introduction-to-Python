Heard this was the best buffet in town besides Bally's hotel . So upon entering the buffet there was no line or wait. Hostess was nice giving us the once around tour because it was our 1st time. The food looked incredible and my mouth was salivating to try it all. I'm the type of person that my first go round is to try it phase then the next time , and the next time I Attack !! Steak and eggs were bomb , omelet was on hit too. Red velvet pancakes yum . Had problems with the country fried potatoes but the onion rings made up for it.                                             Not a big fan of the champagne and orange juice so I instead opted to order the bottomless beer  Yeee !! Sea food was incredible and made sure I did damaged there also. Made a pit stop for the food truck type tacos . Brought it home with the desserts ! Well rounded buffet really , really enjoyed it . Some yelpers I see complained about $$ it's well wort it !! Will come back !!",0,SKteB5rgDlkkUa1Zxe1N0Q

I recommend that you look at everything first and then decide what to get, because you can't possibly try everything.  I missed an entire corner of great food that I didn't see at first, and then I was too full to eat more. I like how everything is on little plates, bowls, or baskets, so everything doesn't get mixed together.  Lines are long, but you can check in and then they text when your time is almost up.  The wait time was less than they had said it would be, so don't go far away to wait.",0,f638AHA_GoHbyDB7VFMz7A

Asian food section and meat selection were great. Seafood area was very limited compared to what was advertised on yelp and their website.  For $50.99 per person on a Saturday night, I would rather be at The Buffet at The Wynn with beautiful flower arrangments surrounding me.",0,-wVPuTiIEG85LwTK46Prpw

But for 50 something dollars for dinner was not worth it....Sorry but if I could choose another place to spend that much I know I would have been much happier. Not to mention they took a photo of us when we came in then brought us like 3-4 printouts of them, I mean nice ones...then they told us it was 15 dollars for one of the pictures...we honestly thought out of all the money we spent we'd at least get the pics for ""free.""  So they went through all the trouble to print them and then are going to throw them away because we didn't want to pay for them? Why not just give us the photos...Food was cold, poor quality of meats, etc..Also not near as big as this looks! Just bummed we spent so much. 
Sorry can't recommend this at all.",0,A21zMqdN76ueLZFpmbue0Q
RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g,0,2012-11-19,0,nq_-8lZPUVGomDEP5OOj1Q,1,"After hearing all the buzz about this place, I decided to check out what the hype is all about.  It was Sunday Brunch and we arrived around 1pm.  The line was loooooong but that was expected.  Once seated at the table, my husband and daughter decided to tackle the ONCE AGAIN LONG LINE at the meat carving station while I decided to tackle the shorter line at the seafood station since I was already starving at this point.   While chowing down on the SUPER SALTY crab legs, I wondered where my husband and daughter were since they still haven't sat down to eat with me.   It nearly took them 30 minutes standing in line at the meat carving station!!  By the time they joined me at the table, I was ready to sample the rest of the food.  I then walked all the way towards the back to the Asian section (by the way the flow of the buffet just doesn't make sense!) to maybe try some sushi or sashimi.   There weren't that many good sushi selections either that's all they has or they just don't replenish fast enough.   I decided to skip the Asian section and walk my way towards the front.  I wanted some cured meats and cheese, but yet again the Parmesan cheese was a whole big block -no shavings or pieces one would have easy access to.  I was looking around for a knife maybe I thought one had to shave the cheese off himself, but no tool was around!  I was really getting frustrated at this point, but I still decided not to give up and try the meat carving station.  I had wishful thinking that the line was going to be shorter this time than when my husband and daughter were here.  Needless to say, the line was not any faster but at this point this was my last resort the last station i want to try since they have Prime Rib - my favorite, so I patiently wait for my turn.  Finally I get Prime Rib with Au Jus on my plate and  FINALLY join my family at the table, to only find out they are ALREADY DONE EATING!  I don't blame them since I was gone for almost 30 minutes!!!   To top it all off, the Au Jus that soaked my Prime Rib was sooo salty that I could only eat 3 bites out of that meat!  I was enraged at this point that I didn't even care to try their desserts!    Not being able to eat at the same time with my family because of the ridiculously long lines at the food stations and to be fed salty dishes is just absurd!   All in all, Bachannal Buffet DOES NOT live up to the hype!   The food is so much better elsewhere!  You're better off going to The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmo or The Studio B Buffet at The M Resort.",2,Jf1EXieUV7F7s-HGA4EsdA

Now that they raised prices (most expensive buffet on strip that I've gone to), I won't return.  Back to Bellagio which is now cheaper.",4,INbqkFXtHeCdEP_wPp2dUA
RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g,1,2014-04-15,0,XeA3BGOhduTRdnprL4ULGQ,4,Best Buffet I experienced in Vegas! You have to be open minded to trying new and gourmet foods very ethnic foods. Everything was cooked to perfection! It was very spendy but worth every Penny!,1,yvlRColhqo_4TzpUFKyroA
