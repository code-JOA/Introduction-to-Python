    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a method for generalizing statistical tests to multiple groups. As you'll see, ANOVA  analyses the overall variance of a dataset by partitioning the total sum of squared deviations (from the mean) into the sum of squares for each of these groups and sum of squares for error. By comparing the statistical test for multiple groups, it can serve as a useful alternative to the t-tests you've encountered thus far when you wish to test multiple factors simultaneously.\n",

    "\n",
    "To perform ANOVA, you begin with sample observations from multiple groups. Since ANOVA is looking to explain the total variance as combinations of variance from the various groups, you typically design a multiple groups experiment to test various independent factors that we hypothesize may influence the overall result. For example, imagine an email campaign designed to optimize donation contributions. In order to get the most money in donations, one might send out two different emails, both copies being identical except for the subject line. This would form a sensible hypothesis test, but if you wanted to test multiple changes simultaneously, swapping out subject line, time sent, thank you gift offers, or other details in the email campaign, then ANOVA would be a more appropriate methodology. In this scenario, you would change one or more of these various features and record the various donations. Once you have sample observations from various combinations of these features, you can then use ANOVA to analyze and compare the effectiveness of the individual features themselves. "

    "The general idea is to break the sum of squared deviations into multiple parts: the sum of squared deviations of the mean of each of the test groups to the observations within the group itself, and the sum of squared deviations of the mean of these test groups to the mean of all observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is easier to understand through the context of an example. For the email case described above, ANOVA would compare the variance of donations within each of the groups to the overall variance of all donations (or lack thereof) as a whole. If the variance of a single group's donations versus that of the overall sample is substantial, there is reason to reject the null hypothesis for that feature. This forms the foundation of the f-test which is at the heart of ANOVA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that you would not perform multiple t-tests with such a scenario because of the multiple comparisons problem. Type I errors will be confounded when conducting multiple t-tests. While the alpha threshold for any one test might be 0.05, it would not be surprising to reject the null hypothesis in at least one of these cases, just by pure chance, if you conduct 5 or 10 t-tests."
