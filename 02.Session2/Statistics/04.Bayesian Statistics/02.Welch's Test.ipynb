    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, you've seen the traditional Student's t-test for hypothesis testing between two sample means. Recall that z-tests are also appropriate for statistics, such as the mean, which can be assumed to be normally distributed. However, when sample sizes are low (n_observations < 30), the t-test is more appropriate, as the t-distribution has heavier tails. Even with this modification, remember that there are still several assumptions to the model. Most notably, traditional t-tests assume that sample sizes and sample variances between the two groups are equal. When these assumptions are not met, Welch's t-test is generally a more reliable test.\n",

    "Recall that t-tests are a useful method for determining whether the mean of two small samples indicate different underlying population parameters. The reasoning behind this begins with the use of z-tests to calculate the likelihood of sampling a particular value from a normal distribution. Furthermore, by the central limit theorem, the mean of a sample is a normally distributed variable centered around the actual underlying population mean. That said, t-tests are more appropriate for small samples (n_observations < 30), due to disproportionate tails. Finally, recall that the t-distribution actually converges to a normal distribution as the degrees of freedom continues to increase.  \n",

    "> A normal distribution vs. t-distributions with varying degrees of freedom. Note how the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increases. Recall that when performing a two-sample t-test, assuming that sample variances are equal, the degrees of freedom equals the total number of observations in the samples minus two."

    "## Welch's t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as Student's t-test is a useful adaptation of the normal distribution which can lead to better likelihood estimates under certain conditions, the Welch's t-test is a further adaptation that accounts for additional perturbations in the underlying assumptions of the model. Specifically, the Student's t-test assumes that the samples are of equal size and equal variance. When these assumptions are not met, then Welch's t-test provides a more accurate p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how you calculate it: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " $ \\Large t = \\frac{\\bar{X_1}-\\bar{X_2}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{N_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{N_2}}} = \\frac{\\bar{X_1}-\\bar{X_2}}{\\sqrt{se_1^2+se_2^2}}$\n",
    "where  \n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\bar{X_i}$ - mean of sample i\n",
    "* $s_i^2$ - variance of sample i\n",
    "* $N_i$ - sample size of sample i  \n",
    "\n",
    "The modification is related to the **degrees of freedom** in the t-test, which tends to increase the test power for samples with unequal variance. When two groups have equal sample sizes and variances, Welch’s t-test tends to give the same result as the Student’s t-test. However, when sample sizes and variances are unequal, Student’s t-test is quite unreliable, whereas Welch’s tends perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculate the degrees of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the t-score has been calculated for the experiment using the above formula, you then must calculate the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution. Under the two-sample Student's t-test, this is simply the total number of observations in the samples size minus two, but given that the sample sizes may vary using the Welch's t-test, the calculation is a bit more complex:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\Large v \\approx \\frac{\\left( \\frac{s_1^2}{N_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{N_2}\\right)^2}{\\frac{s_1^4}{N_1^2v_1} + \\frac{s_2^4}{N_2^2v_2}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculate p-values  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as with the Student's t-test (or a z-test for that matter), you convert the calculated score into a p-value in order to confirm or reject the null-hypothesis of your statistical experiment. For example, you might be using a one-sided t-test to determine whether a new drug had a positive effect on patient outcomes. The p-value for the experiment is equivalent to the area under the t-distribution with the degrees of freedom, as calculated above, and the corresponding t-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/new_AUC.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
